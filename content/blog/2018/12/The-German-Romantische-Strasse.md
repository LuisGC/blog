Some days ago I had the pleasure to make again an awesome road trip with my friend **Agatha**, this time through the German [**Romantische Strasse**](https://www.romantischestrasse.de/). It is not the first (and most probably will not be the last) trip together, you can read about my trips with her through [Scotland](/blog/2018/05/scotland-a-brief-opinionated-guide/), [Austria](/blog/2017/05/romantikstrasse-the-romantic-road_1/), [Brittany](/blog/2017/12/brittany-a-brief-opinionated-guide/) or [Normandy](/blog/2017/12/normandy-a-brief-opinionated-guide/) (and we have made several more).

I'm adding the _German_ adjective to the title because last year I also traveled with her through the [Austrian Romantikstrasse](/blog/2017/05/romantikstrasse-the-romantic-road_1/). We discovered after that trip that a _similar_ one existed in Germany, so it was about time to travel the german one at least to compare. For your information, there are similar routes in [Japan](https://www.romantischestrasse.de/footer-navigationen/commercial/international/japans-romantic-road/?L=1), [Korea](https://www.romantischestrasse.de/footer-navigationen/commercial/international/romantic-road-of-korea/?L=1) and [Brazil](https://www.romantischestrasse.de/footer-navigationen/commercial/international/romantic-road-in-brazil/?L=1). I neither confirm nor deny that now I want to follow those as well (damn _completism_).

I really needed some holidays to disconnect (this year is being difficult and complex in several ways) and I love to travel in December through central Europe to feel their passion for the X-Mas season and the **mulled wine**. Sadly we couldn't plan a lot in advance (again) but we could at least prepare a draft planning of the places we wanted to visit in those eleven days. We planned (and booked) a couple of days for Dachau and Nuremberg at the beginning of the trip and some days in Munich at the end, 2-4 days depending on the days required for our main priority: The **Romantische Strasse**.

In **11 days** we drove **1.035 kilometers**, we visited **20 towns/cities** and we found [30 caches](https://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=b78f2e04-cd1c-4199-820c-7ea3bb7fea20)!!

Let me summarize our experience in the main stops of the trip. Let's start!

## Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site

After having visited [**Auschwitz**](http://auschwitz.org/en/) and [**Mauthausen**](https://www.mauthausen-memorial.org/en) more or less recently, I was not as impressed as others can be with [**Dachau**](http://www.kz-gedenkstaette-dachau.de/index-e.html) but that is only my bias, because Dachau Memorial clearly is worth of a visit.

The _preserved_ part of the original camp is minimum, so the special attractive of Dachau for me was the permanent exhibition located in the former maintenance building, the biggest standing building from the original camp. The explanation about what Dachau was, how it worked and its role in the overall strategy of the Nazis is quite detailed and interesting. They were so proud of the (awful) results that they exported it to other concentration camps as de _Dachau model_.

At the end of the original concentration camp there are several religious temples of different religious faiths. Some of them were closed but in the end they mainly aim at religious people from that specific faith. Nothing to do with the spectacular memorials in Mauthausen.

## Nuremberg

We spent almost 1,5 days in [Nuremberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg), a wonderful place that exceeded my expectations (and they were high). Everything was invaded by tourists because of the seasonal stuff so we happily joined the flock and we walked calmly all the X-Mas stalls, with special attention to the Glühwein ones. We walked a lot through the city center and I loved almost everything that we saw: the Henkersteg (Hangman's Bridge), the Maxbrücke, the Ehekarussell, the Handwerkerhof (Craftmen's Courtyard) and lots of other beautiful streets and buildings. The only locations that we visited properly were the Imperial Castle and the Toy Museum.

The [**Toy Museum**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Toy_Museum) would be interesting just for the fact of having an entire building packed full with toys (some of them new but mostly vintage). Children will enjoy it but also adults of all ages, going through several cabinets of what could have been their toys. One section was entitled for the evolution of the toy concept, where they emphasized the current phenomenon with children _flooded_ by short-lived play stuff, often endangering their creative playing skills. An interesting thought that I mostly share.

The [**Imperial Castle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle) is probably the main attraction in Nuremberg. As almost everything else it was vastly destroyed in the II World War but they successfully rebuilt the entire complex as it was before the war. The exhibition is quite interesting, combining clear explanations of the elements of the Castle in their historical context with information about the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation and the role of the city in that late Middle Ages. I still raise my eyebrows remembering the visit to the _Tiefer Brunnen_ (The Deep Well), you  should not miss it.

I loved to see Nuremberg in X-Mas but I will try to visit again in another season as there is a lot more to see.

## Würzburg

In [Würzburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%BCrzburg) we repeated the tactic. We arrived in the evening to see the city after dawn, and in the next morning we visited the main attraction: the [**Würzburg Residence**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%BCrzburg_Residence), a clear masterwork of German Baroque.

Here we found again some of the places closed (some of them closed for the entire winter) but in overall the town looked fantastic and also worth for another visit at least to see the Gardens and the [Marienberg Fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marienberg_Fortress).

## Tauberbischofsheim

After leaving Würzburg we made a quick stop in [Tauberbischofsheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tauberbischofsheim). We could just visit the Saint Martin church as the rest was closed for the winter, but the visit was worthy anyway. The medieval old town is fantastic and very well preserved, including an interesting Neo-Gothic town hall. We left after a quiet meal watching an intense rain fall through the windows.

## Bad Mergentheim

We left [Bad Mergentheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Mergentheim) after one evening and part of the next morning without been able to visit the [Castle of the Teutonic Order](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schloss_Mergentheim) and the [Teutonic Order Museum](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutschordensmuseum) but in overall it was again a nice visit because the old town was splendid, specially with the seasonal lights and stalls. The heavy rain continued so we had little more to do.

## Weikersheim

Weikersheim was one of the biggest surprises of the trip. The old town was also cute, but I want to highlight the [Weikersheim Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weikersheim_Castle), a fabulous Renaissance palace with Baroque gardens.

The 40 meters long _Knights' Hall_ at the Palace is the most astounding thing that I have seen in ages. It is dedicated to hunting and secret worlds, and any visitor will be amazed by dozens of life-size three-dimensional figures of wildlife animals made in painted stucco, mostly of those that could be hunted in the surroundings but also including exotic pieces like an elephant. The wooden ceiling is also entirely covered with pictures of hunting scenes mixed with local legends. A unique place.

We enjoyed a lot the Castle, if any of the other places that we found closed are similar the _Romantische Strasse_ will clearly worth a second visit.

We also visited the [Sternwarte Weikersheim Observatory](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternwarte_Weikersheim), just in case it was open, but we were unlucky again.

## Röttingen

[Röttingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B6ttingen) was another quick visit before lunch. Their well preserved medieval fortifications and old town deserved a visit. The [Brattenstein Castle](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burg_Brattenstein) looked nice, it was closed but we could at least see that it also serves as a small open air theater. Another interesting place in seasons with better weather conditions.

We also discovered a sun-dial hike trail around the town, with a different type of sun-dial in each stop. Nice also for longer stays.

## Rothenburg ob der Tauber

[Rothenburg ob der Tauber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothenburg_ob_der_Tauber) was probably the town that I enjoyed the most from the entire Romantische Strasse. It does not have an iconic place (like a fine Palace or a landmark Castle) but the entire old town is somehow magical. The battlements that surround its huge medieval center can be traversed (and we did it) for a length of 2.5 km, allowing anyone to surround from the heights almost the complete perimeter.

We only visited one Museum out of pure curiosity, the [German Christmas Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A4the_Wohlfahrt). The Museum itself is interesting but not an unforgettable place, but the free-entry Christmas decoration shop behind (or around) it is completely amazing and singular. In fact, the Museum is _inside_ this huge shop that belongs to a famous German company that sells Christmas decorations in several stores across Germany and in some other locations worldwide. This one is the head office and it is open all year long, claiming to have the world's largest selection of traditional Christmas ornaments. It totally deserves a visit, if you are disciplined and you can resist the temptation to buy things like crazy.

During the highly advisable Night Watchman walking tour we heard some interesting stories. One of them caught my attention so I will summarize it for you, after having confirmed its authenticity. March 1945, II World War is about to end but some German soldiers are barricaded here taking advantage of the huge city wall. Lots of bombs are dropped killing dozens of people and destroying >300 buildings, several watchtowers and part of the wall. In that moment the U.S. Assistant Secretary of War, [John J. McCloy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._McCloy), knowing (allegedly) about the beauty of Rothenburg orders to stop immediately the artillery attacks and gives three hours to a small group of American soldiers to negotiate the surrender of the town, or it will be bombed massively. At that moment in time Rothenburg was not as touristic as it is today and it was pure luck (almost miracle, according to the watchman) that the mother of Mr McCloy had a painting of the town at home that the Assistant Secretary of War had seen several times as a child, hearing wonderful stories about the place. The local Nazi commander, agreeing on the importance of preserving the city, betrayed Hitler's direct orders and committed treason surrendering the city. Since November 1948 McCloy is also honorary citizen of Rothenburg.

The Watchman gave us also another thought provoking insight: Rothenburg was severely depopulated in the 17th century by the [Thirty Years' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War) and a bubonic plague outbreak and its economy was a mess during a couple of centuries. It was not until the end of the 19th century when several artists from the german [Romanticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism) visited the place with the first tourists and some regulations were created to prevent major changes in the old town. In some way, as he told us thankfully, all the current economic wealth is thanks to a long lasting extreme poverty that preserved the 16th-17th century state.

I really need to stop writing about this place if I want to finish this chronicle, but before going to the next one let me show you the most picturesque, photographed and painted place in Rothenburg.

## Dinkelsbühl

We stopped at [Dinkelsbühl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkelsb%C3%BChl) during the lunch time, in order to eat something nice there and apparently we made a usual plan, according to the huge amount of restaurants that Dinkelsbühl has. After lunch we made a nice walking tour though the city center with some daylight surrounding the whole town center inside and outside the city wall.

There are interesting places to see/visit here like a [3rd Dimension Museum](http://www.3d-museum.de/) but my suggestion is to at least walk calmly through it, passing through some of the splendid gates of the wall: the Wörnitz gate, the Segringen gate, the Nördlingen gate or the Rothenburg gate to name the most beautiful ones.

## Nördlingen

We arrived in [Nördlingen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%B6rdlingen) in the evening, so again we walked through it at night, to enjoy the seasonal decoration and the X-Mas Market delicacies, and we walked it again calmly in the following morning.

Again, as in Dinkelsbühl and Rothenburg ob der Tauber, this is the third almost perfectly preserved medieval town center with a fully walkable battlements (the only three in Germany) that can be traversed, in this case for more than 2.5 km. I suppose that reading this summary it all sounds quite similar but in reality each town had its own personality and _touch_, so our visits were not overlapping with the previous ones but adding a lot to a great overall experience.

The city was built in the middle of a meteorite impact crater, so they have the [the Rieskrater Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rieskrater_Museum) dedicated to the crater explaining some geological facts. Another important museum in Nördlingen is the [Bayerische Eisenbahnmuseum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavarian_Railway_Museum) with more than one hundred original railway vehicles. We could not visit them but for a longer stay here they are quite interesting.

## Augsburg

We spent the rest of the morning in [Donauwörth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donauw%C3%B6rth) (nice but nothing remarkable) to finally arrive in [Augsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augsburg) again in the late afternoon.

Augsburg was for me, undoubtedly, one of the most special stages of the trip. The seasonal markets were again everywhere with a noticeable quality in the products and decorations, even in the Glühwein (I plead guilty of tasting them all) and the city itself is gloriously beautiful. Lots of buildings and scenes breath history through their doors and walls.

Again, we could not visit everything we wanted (for example the _Mozart House_, where the composer's father Leopold was born and the musician visited several times) but the places we visited were amazing. The [Maximilian Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilian_Museum) of decorative arts was remarkable, the Cathedral was nice but the most clear must see of the town is the [Goldener Saal (Golden Hall)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augsburg_Town_Hall) in the Town Hall, a >550 square meters hall with large murals and numerous ceiling paintings all of them richly adorned with golden frames and decoration. Astonishing. During the visit we learned that it was badly damaged during the II World War and it was renovated and redecorated between the 80s and 90s, according to historical photographs and blueprints.

## Landsberg am Lech

[Landsberg am Lech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landsberg_am_Lech) was a last minute addition to our trip. We initially discarded it but we finally went there and we did not regret at all. It is a small town, with little to see apart from its nice streets but at least I wanted to visit in person a picturesque tower that is located there: the [Mutterturm](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Mutterturm).

What we found was a lively town center with several people enjoying the X-Mas market delicacies (yes, lots of Glühwein again) that forced us to extend our stay. In our way back from the car, after putting a new parking ticket, a fabulous sunset with a bright rainbow totally surprised us. A perfect spot with the perfect timing.

## Schwangau

## Füssen

## Munich


I hope that you enjoyed the guide!
