Some days ago I had the pleasure to make again an awesome road trip with my friend **Agatha**, this time through the German [**Romantische Strasse**](https://www.romantischestrasse.de/). It is not the first (and most probably will not be the last) trip together, you can read about my trips with her through [Scotland](/blog/2018/05/scotland-a-brief-opinionated-guide/), [Austria](/blog/2017/05/romantikstrasse-the-romantic-road_1/), [Brittany](/blog/2017/12/brittany-a-brief-opinionated-guide/) or [Normandy](/blog/2017/12/normandy-a-brief-opinionated-guide/) (and we have made several more).

I'm adding the _German_ adjective to the title because last year I also traveled with her through the [Austrian Romantikstrasse](/blog/2017/05/romantikstrasse-the-romantic-road_1/). We discovered after that trip that a _similar_ one existed in Germany, so it was about time to travel the german one at least to compare. For your information, there are similar routes in [Japan](https://www.romantischestrasse.de/footer-navigationen/commercial/international/japans-romantic-road/?L=1), [Korea](https://www.romantischestrasse.de/footer-navigationen/commercial/international/romantic-road-of-korea/?L=1) and [Brazil](https://www.romantischestrasse.de/footer-navigationen/commercial/international/romantic-road-in-brazil/?L=1). I neither confirm nor deny that now I want to follow those as well (damn _completism_).

I really needed some holidays to disconnect (this year is being difficult and complex in several ways) and I love to travel in December through central Europe to feel their passion for the X-Mas season and the **mulled wine**. Sadly we couldn't plan a lot in advance (again) but we could at least prepare a draft planning of the places we wanted to visit in those eleven days. We planned (and booked) a couple of days for Dachau and Nuremberg at the beginning of the trip and some days in Munich at the end, 2-4 days depending on the days required for our main priority: The **Romantische Strasse**.

In **11 days** we drove **1.035 kilometers**, we visited **20 towns/cities** and we found [30 caches](https://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=b78f2e04-cd1c-4199-820c-7ea3bb7fea20)!!

Let me summarize our experience in the main stops of the trip. Let's start!

## Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site

After having visited [**Auschwitz**](http://auschwitz.org/en/) and [**Mauthausen**](https://www.mauthausen-memorial.org/en) more or less recently, I was not as impressed as others can be with [**Dachau**](http://www.kz-gedenkstaette-dachau.de/index-e.html) but that is only my bias, because Dachau Memorial clearly is worth of a visit.

The _preserved_ part of the original camp is minimum, so the special attractive of Dachau for me was the permanent exhibition located in the former maintenance building, the biggest standing building from the original camp. The explanation about what Dachau was, how it worked and its role in the overall strategy of the Nazis is quite detailed and interesting. They were so proud of the (awful) results that they exported it to other concentration camps as de _Dachau model_.

At the end of the original concentration camp there are several religious temples of different religious faiths. Some of them were closed but in the end they mainly aim at religious people from that specific faith. Nothing to do with the spectacular memorials in Mauthausen.
