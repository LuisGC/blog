After an uncertain landing a few hours ago (the airport in Madrid was barely working due to a snowy morning), I've arrived home but instead of having some rest after three days in Brussels I felt the urge to start writing about the weekend.

I've been there not only to enjoy this wonderful city with it's trappist beers and great food, but specially to attend **FOSDEM** as I intend to do every year.

For those of you who don't know [**FOSDEM**](https://fosdem.org/), it's the biggest conference in Europe (and one of the biggest around the world) related to **Open Source** development. It's a huge event with hundreds of talks, workshops, gatherings and stands from all the relevant projects and communities in the **FOSS (Free and Open Source Software)** ecosystem. It's also a marvelous place to do networking, because there are not only representatives of those projects but normally also the technical leaders of them. If you are good with faces (or with voices, like [**@lekum**](https://twitter.com/lekum)!) you can meet and greet a lot of important and interesting people.

I already wrote about it a couple of years ago, when I even gave a lightning talk in one [FOSDEM Fringe event](https://archive.fosdem.org/2016/fringe/) the [Floss Community Metrics Meeting (FCM2)](http://flosscommunitymetrics.org/).

* [FOSDEM 2016: Friday](/blog/2016/03/fosdem-2016-friday.html)
* [FOSDEM 2016: Saturday](/blog/2016/03/fosdem-2016-saturday.html)
* [FOSDEM 2016: Sunday](/blog/2016/03/fosdem-2016-sunday.html)

The numbers of this year speak for themselves:

* more than 8,000 attendees in only two days
* [652 speakers](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/speakers/) in [690 different events](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/events/) (talks or workshops, mainly)
* [57 tracks](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/roomtracks/) in 33 different rooms
* [more than 350 hours of content](https://video.fosdem.org/), almost all of the events are [available online with live streaming](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/streaming/) during the conference
* [56 stands](https://fosdem.org/2018/stands/) of all kinds of projects: [FSFE](https://fsfe.org/), [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf), [the Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/), [OSI](https://opensource.org/), [the Eclipse Foundation](https://eclipse.org/), [O'Reilly](http://www.oreilly.com/), [Fedora](http://getfedora.org/), [OpenSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/), [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) [KDE](http://www.kde.org/), [Gnome](http://gnome.org/), [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/), [VLC](https://videolan.org/), [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), [Perl](http://www.perl.org/), ...

To make it more impressive, take into account that FOSDEM is **organized by volunteers**, everything is **community driven** and it's **free to attend**. You don't even need to register beforehand.

As usual, let me summarize some of the talks that I attended:

# Talks

[**Consensus as a Service, Twenty Years of OSI Stewardship**](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/osi/), by [Simon Phipps](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/speaker/simon_phipps/) and [Italo Vignoli](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/speaker/italo_vignoli/)

The _Open Source_ label was born in February 3rd 1998, so we celebrated its 20th Anniversary during the opening day of FOSDEM 2018. Simon (President of the [OSI](https://opensource.org/)) summarized the evolution of the Open Source environment in the last two decades, also guessing what are going to be the main challenges for the Free Open Source Software for it's third decade.

He remarked that Open Source projects should not have a business model, the companies that uses those OS projects are the ones that need a realistic business model. I totally agree with this, OS projects can be relevant and positive for the society in a lot more ways than profitability of the founders. Open Source allows software users and developers to advance in their software freedom at work as well as in private.

He labeled the first decade (1998-2008) the decade of _Advocacy & Controversy_. We all still remember when [in 2001 Steve Ballmer as CEO of Microsoft said "Linux is a cancer"](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/02/ballmer_linux_is_a_cancer/) (although now [apparently he loves it](http://www.zdnet.com/article/ballmer-i-may-have-called-linux-a-cancer-but-now-i-love-it/)), or in 2005 when UNIX was made Open Source, or 2007 when Java was also made Open Source. In the beginning most OS was a proprietary replacement, but at the end of the decade everyone understood OS as a benefit.

Simon labeled the second decade (2008-2018) the decade of _Adoption and Ascendancy_, with three main aspects: broad enterprise adoption, problems with software patents and GPL enforcement. Since 2008 most _hidden_ infrastructure is based in OS, since 2011 OS enabled the web service business era, since 2013 the OS is powering the cloud/containers revolution, ... to the point that nowadays we can realize that Open Source is at the heart of most new software.

Simon quoted [Eben Moglen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eben_Moglen) and his "Licenses are Constitutions for Communities", and explained that "Open Source licenses are the multilateral consensus of the permissions and norms for a Community". That's why it's important to respect the licenses, and that explains why for the community any violation of the license it's felt like an awful aggression.

Derived from the [four essential freedoms of Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.en), Simon emphasized the real value of Open Source:

* Innovate without needing to ask first
* Start where others reached
* Stay in control of your own resources
* Share upkeep of your innovation
* Influence global ecosystems
* Be protected from others doing the same

Maybe my favorite talk this year. Don't expect summaries as long as this one for other talks :-P
