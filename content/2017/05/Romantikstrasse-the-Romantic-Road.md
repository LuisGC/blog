A couple of weeks ago I had the immense pleasure of making a road trip through Austria following what they call the [**Romantikstraße**](http://www.romantikstrasse.at/es/), *Romantic Road* or *Romantic Trail* in English. Interestingly, ours was a **singles** trip initially planned for three friends but sadly in the end we were only two because at the last minute Roberto had to cancel. I shared this great adventure only with Agatha and it was great (as expected). I suppose that in the eyes of any innkeeper or bartender we were a happy couple celebrating something.

Having said that, I didn't notice any special _romantic atmosphere_ beyond the surrounding beautiful landscapes, fantastic lakes and awesome mountains. Some might say that my sense of romanticism is broken, and it may be possible, but for me Nature is not romantic by itself. Luckily the shops, restaurants and villages in general didn't focus on selling this concept to the visitors. In fact it was very unlikely to find a sign about the Romantikstraße off the main roads of the route. But enough talking about the commercial name of the route.

Let me summarize our experience, mainly anecdotes and tips. Prices, timetables and other General tourist information is easy to find and sometimes expires soon. I'll love to read it in the future and it could be useful for anyone planning a similar trip. You can also read [Agatha's review in her blog](https://detintasuelta.blogspot.com.es/2017/05/romantikstrasse-por-austria.html) (in Spanish). She [prepared the route perfectly in advance](https://detintasuelta.blogspot.com.es/2017/02/preparando-la-romantikstrasse-por.html) and we mainly followed her plan, we only needed a couple of improvised detours.

# TL;DR

* The area covered by the Romantikstraße is totally amazing. Everything is beautiful, looks shiny, deserves a zillion pictures or to sit for a while to admire the landscape. Especially the latter
* It's not a cheap trip, but it's not as expensive as Switzerland
* We spent 4,5 days there and it was enough but the trip deserves at least a couple days more
* Hallstatt is very beautiful, but it's not the most beautiful village in the world. Covarrubias is (of course)

# Preparing the Romantikstraße

If you are not as lucky as I was and you need to prepare the trip in advance, my first recommendation is to visit the [official website of the Romantikstraße](http://www.romantikstrasse.at/en/). There you'll find a lot of info about the route and the main attractions. You can also request a brochure of the route in several languages for free, we did it and it was useful during the trip.

About the accommodation, depending on the dates of the trip it may be essential to book everything in advance. Some villages are very small and have few options to choose from. We booked in advance only the first night and a couple of nights we needed a considerable detour from the route, and it was low season.

# Day 1

## Schallaburg

After wasting more than 1 hour in the airport waiting the queue of the car rental company our first destination was the [**Schallaburg Castle**](http://www.schallaburg.at/en?set_language=en), a >900 years old castle very well preserved located on top of a hill surrounded by forest. In addition to the privileged situation, the castle offers a very well arranged garden. This first stop reminded me of my bicycle trip through [La Loire à Vélo](http://www.cycling-loire.com/).

The castle also hosts temporal exibitions and a very nice restaurant in the courtyard called _Schloss_. Apart from the regional specialities, the restaurant changes it's menu and decoration to match the running exibitions. During our visit the main exhibition was about Islam and we could acclimitize to the country with a regional craft beer and some falafel.

The first funny anecdote of the trip arrived soon. From the parking to the castle we saw two different roads, both very steep. Ignoring a medium-sized sign in german we followed the nearest of them, because in [**OSMAnd**](http://osmand.net/) I could see that it was more direct to the gardens and the castle. After visiting the garden, the courtyard of the castle, the restaurant and most of the open rooms (and some closed ones), we noticed that we had paid nothing to be there. We went back to the parking lot using the other way and confirmed that we'd skipped the ticket office. I leave to your imagination if we warned them of our mistake and paid the entrance.

Before leaving, we found [our first cache of the trip](https://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=dc7d5446-009c-4332-8fde-2881d06a4882), less than 5 meters from our car :-)
