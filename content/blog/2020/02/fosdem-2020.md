It has been almost a month since I returned from another intense and thought-provoking weekend in Brussels, although it still feels like it was just yesterday. I couldn't write this before, I have had a busy month both at work and at home.

For those of you who don't know [**FOSDEM**](https://fosdem.org/), it is the biggest conference in Europe (and one of the biggest around the world) related to **Open Source** development and communities. It's a huge event with hundreds of talks, workshops, gatherings and stands from all the relevant projects and communities in the **FOSS (Free and Open Source Software)** ecosystem. It's also a marvelous place to do networking, because there are not only representatives of those projects but normally also the technical leaders of them. If you are good with names and faces you can meet and greet a lot of important and interesting people.

I already wrote about it in previous years:

* **FOSDEM 2016**: [Friday](/blog/2016/03/fosdem-2016-friday/), [Saturday](/blog/2016/03/fosdem-2016-saturday/) and [Sunday](/blog/2016/03/fosdem-2016-sunday/)
* **FOSDEM 2018**: [Saturday](/blog/2018/02/fosdem-2018-saturday/) and [Sunday](/blog/2018/02/fosdem-2018-sunday/)
* **FOSDEM 2019**: [Saturday](/blog/2019/02/fosdem-2019-saturday/) and [Sunday](/blog/2019/02/fosdem-2019-sunday/)

The [numbers of this 2020 edition](https://twitter.com/vishwajeets3/status/1224021852349255682) speak for themselves, improving all the figures from previous years:

* more than 8,000 attendees in only two days
* [781 speakers](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/speakers/) in [817 different events](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/events/) (talks or workshops, mainly)
* [71 tracks](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/rooms/) in 35 different rooms
* [more than 400 hours of content](https://video.fosdem.org/2020/), almost all of the events are [available online with live streaming](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/streaming/) during the conference
* [63 stands](https://fosdem.org/2020/stands/) of all kinds of projects: [FSFE](https://fsfe.org/), [the Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/), [OSI](https://opensource.org/), [the Eclipse Foundation](https://eclipse.org/), [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/), [Fedora](http://getfedora.org/), [OpenSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/), [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) [KDE](http://www.kde.org/), [Gnome](http://gnome.org/), [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/), [Mattermost](https://www.mattermost.com/), [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org/), [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), ...

To make it more impressive, take into account that FOSDEM is **organized by volunteers**, everything is **community driven** and it's **free to attend**. You don't even need to register beforehand.

As usual, let me summarize some of the talks that I attended (in chronological order):

# Talks

[**How FOSS could revolutionize municipal government**](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/municipal_government/), by Danese Cooper

Danese Cooper ([@divadanese](https://twitter.com/divadanese)) complete career is amazing: former CTO at [Wikimedia Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation), board member of the [Open Source Hardware Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Hardware_Association), board observer at [Mozilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla) and board member at [Open Source Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Initiative),... She gave at FOSDEM a very interesting and inspiring talk about the growing presence of FOSS in public administrations.

She started with a brief historical review of relevant projects, highlighting [LinEx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GnuLinEx) in Extremadura and [Code For America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_for_America). This initiatives to provide an open alternative for a specific purpose have sometimes failed. In the last years several projects are becoming popular with a common pattern: acting locally to impact globally.

For example: Jason Hibbets ([@jhibbets](https://twitter.com/jhibbets)) makes small [FOSS projects for his regional county in Raleigh, North Carolina](http://theopensourcecity.com/). In Baltimore, a [city that was hacked and had to pay a ransom to recover its servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Baltimore_ransomware_attack), the amazing people from the [St. Francis Neighborhood Center](https://www.stfranciscenter.org/) lead by Jacob Green are adapting an international open source platform to provide city services, webs and other functions.

This international open source platform is [**Lutèce**](https://github.com/lutece-platform) ([@LuteceNews](https://twitter.com/LuteceNews)), developed by the City of Paris. Lutèce is a 12 years old modular and extensible platform, covering hundreds of city services. Through several projects, mainly built in Java EE, it covers from basic web capabilities to voting systems or workflow functions. Awesome.
