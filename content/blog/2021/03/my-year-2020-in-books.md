Any [**Goodreads**](https://www.goodreads.com/) user has access to a yearly report with some statistics and basically the covers of all the books read in one year. In order to have it the user only has to set the books as _read_ and the _read date_ to any time in that year. Taking advantage of this nice feature I will summarize [My 2020 in Books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2020/12155365) from Goodreads, as I did for [my read books in 2018](/blog/2019/01/my-year-2018-in-books/) and [2019](/blog/2020/01/my-year-2019-in-books/).

The featured image goes to [James Rhodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Rhodes_(pianist)), as I liked a lot his autobiography. You can [read my review in Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3077000571?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1) but I will summarize it here with the first sentence: _Instrumental is a terrible book and at the same time a wonderful one. Knowing the James Rhodes from nowadays, and knowing already a bit about his past, it is even more emotional_.

I'm not copying here the full list, [friend me on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12155365-luis) if you are curious, but at least I want to highlight some of them.
