# Day 2

## Kremsmünster

For me, [**Kremsmünster Abbey**](https://stift-kremsmuenster.net/tourismus/information-in-english/english/) was the most positive surprise of the entire trip. A priori it looked like _yet another_ abbey, and our first hour there not only was confirming that suspicion but also made us feel somewhat deceived. We paid a considerable amount of money to find out that the ticket didn't include the visit of what we particularly wanted to see in there: The **Tassilo Chalice**, the **Library** and the **Mathematical Tower**. We could enter only the public areas and the inner gardens where they temporaly hosted a floral exhibition. The information was confusing, mostly in german only, and the variety of ticket options was the most complex that I've ever seen in a place like this.

After visiting the gardens and the Abbey Church we followed some unclear signs to the Tassilo, and when we were almost there a couple of exhibition guides insisted us that our tickets didn't include this area, so they charged us again (without any kind of ticket) to enter the Treasure Chamber and a couple more rooms with minor interest. The Tassilo is an interesting piece of art and history, but the extra price to see it seemed disproportionate.

We were about to leave, almost angry, but finally we bought another additional ticket to visit the _panorama terrace_ on top of the [Mathematical Tower](http://www.specula.at/). The panorama terrace visit only included climbing up the stairs and going out on the terrace to see the views from there. The rest of the building was not included in our handful of tickets but at least we'd see some of what we initially wanted.

And there, waiting at the entrance of the tower, our luck changed with the stellar appearance of **Anna**. I'll call her Anna as the [most popular female name in Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_given_names#Female_names_4) to preserve her identity, not because I don't remember her real name.

The incredible kindness of Anna, her desire to practice spoken English and the fact that there were no more tourists in the visit, made our day radically better. Waiting to see if anyone else was joining the visit we told her about our bad luck and poor understanding of the information for tourists, and she emphatized and wanted to compensate us in some way. She couldn't realize that we'd bought like three different tickets to leave without seeing what we expected to see (the main attractions, by the way).

We climbed the Tower, but instead of going directly to the top we stopped at each floor and briefly visited the exhibition rooms. One room was a small Natural History collection with several stuffed animals, minerals, all kind of insects, other contained an interesting collection of vintage astronomical devices and globes, another presented diverse regional folklore, ethnology and popular costumes,... We didn't make any picture acknowledging that the visit was unofficial, but I can still remember an amazing cabinet with a curious [Xylotheque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylotheque), pieces of different types of wood carved as books that contained their characteristic leaf, fruit or flower. I'd found a picture in Wikimedia, take a look right here.

Anna's infinite friendliness did not end there. On our way down she offered to negotiate for us a private visit to the Library, guided by herself. She managed to convince her boss, and paying an additional ticket at a reduced price we got to see the rest of the art collections and the impressive Library. We visited the Imperial Hall, several rooms with a nice art collection (mainly paintings) and finally the Library. We could've spent hours there...

We've planned to be in Kremsmünster just a couple of hours , but finally we were there all morning so we had to lunch just there, in a traditional restaurant inside the Abbey grounds: [Stiftsschank](http://www.stiftsschank-kremsmuenster.or.at/). It was great so we recommend it as well.

## Scharnstein

**Scharnstein** stands out for its variety of hiking trails, since it's surrounded by forests and mountains. It's also near [Totes Gebirge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totes_Gebirge), a picturesque mountain range part of the Limestone Alps.

Our extended visit to the Kremsmünster Abbey forced us to expend less time here, but at least we could do some light hiking. We made one of the short but typical routes, climbing from the town to the **ruins of the Scharnstein Castle**. Both the ascent and the exploration of the ruins were fantastic. We were lucky enough to be completely alone, so it was a relaxing experience and a total immersion in the Nature that surrounded us. The views were excellent, with the remains of the castle with the huge Almtal valley behind.
