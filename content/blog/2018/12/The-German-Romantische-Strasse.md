Some days ago I had the pleasure to make again an awesome road trip with my friend **Agatha**, this time through the German [**Romantische Strasse**](https://www.romantischestrasse.de/). It is not the first (and most probably will not be the last) trip together, you can read about my trips with her through [Scotland](/blog/2018/05/scotland-a-brief-opinionated-guide/), [Austria](/blog/2017/05/romantikstrasse-the-romantic-road_1/), [Brittany](/blog/2017/12/brittany-a-brief-opinionated-guide/) or [Normandy](/blog/2017/12/normandy-a-brief-opinionated-guide/) (and we have made several more).

I'm adding the _German_ adjective to the title because last year I also traveled with her through the [Austrian Romantikstrasse](/blog/2017/05/romantikstrasse-the-romantic-road_1/). We discovered after that trip that a _similar_ one existed in Germany, so it was about time that we visited the german one at least to compare. For your information, there are similar routes in [Japan](https://www.romantischestrasse.de/footer-navigationen/commercial/international/japans-romantic-road/?L=1), [Korea](https://www.romantischestrasse.de/footer-navigationen/commercial/international/romantic-road-of-korea/?L=1) and [Brazil](https://www.romantischestrasse.de/footer-navigationen/commercial/international/romantic-road-in-brazil/?L=1). I neither confirm nor deny that now I want to follow those (damn _completism_).

I really needed some holidays to disconnect, this year is being crazy and complex in several ways, and I love to travel in December through central Europe to feel their passion for the X-Mas season. Sadly we couldn't plan a lot in advance (again) but we planned enough to have a draft planning of the places we wanted to visit in those eleven days. We planned (and booked) a couple of days for Dachau and Nuremberg at the beginning of the trip and we planned to stay in Munich 2-4 days at the end, depending on the days required for our main priority: The **Romantische Strasse**.

In **11 days** we drove **1.035 kilometers**, we visited **20 towns/cities** and we found [30 caches](https://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=b78f2e04-cd1c-4199-820c-7ea3bb7fea20)!!
