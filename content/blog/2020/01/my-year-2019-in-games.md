## Retrospective

This time, I'll organize the analysis in categories, as the time I spent in RPG or video games is becoming much more relevant.

### Boardgames

* 2019 has been the year with less plays since 2009.
* I've played only 33 different games this year, and incredibly most of them were new (to me).
* I recorded 37 gaming sessions, 3 per month.
* My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index"><b><i>h-index</i></b></a> as a player is still at <b>11</b>. I expected to raise it this year, but I haven't since I almost played new games.
* I have played a lot less to boardgames. Nothing unexpected as this year I haven't been able to attend [Tierra de Nadie (TdN)](http://jornadas-tdn.org/) or any similar convention. Not attending TdN implies at least 25-30 plays less.
* On the other side, the number of gaming sessions is not that different. And makes sense as I'm playing more to longer games.
* Only In 2019 I have played 19 times to [**Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle Earth**](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/269385/lord-rings-journeys-middle-earth), in several sessions with up to 4 straight plays. I'm enjoying it a lot (as the rest of my playing group), so we are continuing with [The Hunt of the Ember Crown](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/295353/lord-rings-journeys-middle-earth-hunt-ember-crown) expansion. I'm even considering starting a solitaire campaign to compare.
* I did not fulfill my desire to complete in 2019 all the published games of [**Unlock!**](https://rpggeek.com/boardgamefamily/39442/unlock) and [**Exit**](https://rpggeek.com/boardgamefamily/36963/exit-das-spiel), but I played 5 and I have bought almost all of them so it's a matter of time.

### Role-playing games

* We are still maintaining our monthly [**Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition**](https://rpggeek.com/rpg/17181/dungeons-dragons-5th-edition) campaign. I've only skipped a couple of sessions because of business trips or similar issues, and despite that I've attended 10 sessions.
* I'm sure we will continue with this in 2020 and beyond, if nothing important changes. We will see what happens when we complete the [Storm King's Thunder](https://rpggeek.com/rpgitem/203811/storm-kings-thunder) campaign.

### Video games

* This year I've used [**Steam**](https://store.steampowered.com/) from time to time. Chronologically:
  - I completed [**Baldur's Gate II**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/257350/Baldurs_Gate_II_Enhanced_Edition/)
  - I played for a while to [**Icewind Dale**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/321800/Icewind_Dale_Enhanced_Edition/)
  - I finished [**Life is Strange: Episode 1**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/319630/Life_is_Strange__Episode_1/)
  - I also completed [**The Witcher**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/20900/The_Witcher_Enhanced_Edition_Directors_Cut/)
* By the end of the year I acquired [**Stadia** Founder's Edition](https://stadia.google.com/). I started trying it with [**Destiny 2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_2) but definitely enjoyed my new Stadia with [**Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Raider_(2013_video_game)).
* Either on Steam or Stadia, I plan to play as much as I can also this year. For the moment, I'm continuing with [**Rise of the Tomb Raider**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_of_the_Tomb_Raider)
