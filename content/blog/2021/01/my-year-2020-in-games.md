## Retrospective

I will organize again the analysis in categories, as the time I spent in RPG or video games is becoming much more relevant.

### Boardgames

* In 2020 I have played more than in the previous years, but specially longer games, and I have played just 20 different games.
* I recorded 62 gaming sessions, more than 5 per month.
* My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index"><b><i>h-index</i></b></a> as a player is now <b>12</b>. I expected to raise it this year, as I have played intensively to a few games.
* I have played 48 times to [**Gloomhaven**](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174430/gloomhaven). That is more than half the games I've played in the whole year.

### Role-playing games

* With just 8 sessions, mostly online due to the pandemic, we closed in June our [**Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition**](https://rpggeek.com/rpg/17181/dungeons-dragons-5th-edition) campaign.
* For the moment, we haven't started a new one, with D&D or not, but I hope we will be able to do it as soon as the situation allows it.

### Video games

* This year I have played more video games than ever, probably.
* In [**Steam**](https://store.steampowered.com/) I have played:
  - Mostly [**Tabletop Simulator**](https://steamcommunity.com/app/286160). I have more than 150h only from 2020.
  - I played for a while to [**This War of Mine**](https://steamcommunity.com/app/282070). Interesting and challenging, I will probably play again when in the proper mood.
  - I finished [**Firewatch**](https://steamcommunity.com/app/383870). An intense and well written story. Some passages ended up being too repetitive but the game is short overall.
  - I completed [**The Darkside Detective**](https://steamcommunity.com/app/368390). Interesting and challenging puzzles, good laughs with a nice design and a fantastic retro based characters and stories.
* In January I bought a second hand Playstation 4 from a colleague (without knowing about covid-19 yet) and starting from April I used it a lot. I have completed:
  - [**Marvel's Spiderman**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(2018_video_game))
  - [**Journey**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_(2012_video_game))
  - [**The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_3:_Wild_Hunt)
  - [**Uncharted: Drake's Fortune**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted:_Drake%27s_Fortune)
  - [**Uncharted 2: Among Thieves**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_2:_Among_Thieves)
  - [**Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_3:_Drake%27s_Deception)
  - [**Call of Duty: Black Ops III**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Black_Ops_III)
  - [**Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Infinite_Warfare)
  - [**Mass Effect: Andromeda**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect:_Andromeda)
  - [**Dragon Age Inquisition**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Age:_Inquisition)
* Despite having a new PlayStation, I have tried to play in [**Stadia**](https://stadia.google.com/) as well, as a PRO subscriber. I haven't used the subscription so I finally cancelled it. In 2020 I played.
  - [**Destiny 2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_2), I like the game and I've spent several hours but I haven't engaged yet with it.
  - [**Rise of the Tomb Raider**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_of_the_Tomb_Raider).
  - [**Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Jedi:_Fallen_Order)


Either on Steam, PS4 or Stadia, I plan to keep playing as much as I can also this year. Perhaps eventually in PS5, who knows?
