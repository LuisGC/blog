I've just arrived home after attending another fantastic [**Greach Conference**](http://greachconf.com/), an international conference that in previous years was focused on the [Apache Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org/) language and ecosystem ([Grails](https://grails.org/), [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), etc.) but this year has expanded the scope to other technologies related to the [JVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) like [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/), [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/), [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), [Android](https://developer.android.com/), ...

Greach is a **non-profitable** event held in Madrid since 2011. This year for the first time the organizers were [**Sergio del Amo**](http://sergiodelamo.es/) y [**José Miguel Rodríguez**](https://jmiguel.eu/), with some help from colleagues and [a lot of sponsors](https://www.greachconf.com/sponsors).

**TLDR;** The conference was, as expected, great both in content and speakers. It's a must for me, specially being held here in Madrid. This is still a Groovy lovers conference, but this year [**Micronaut**](http://micronaut.io/) was omnipresent. Some speakers also put the focus on [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) as technologies to follow closely.

Let me summarize some of the talks I attended:

# Talks

[**JVM Frameworks Keynote**](https://agenda.greachconf.com/talk/keynote-jvm-frameworks), by [Andrés Almiray](https://agenda.greachconf.com/speaker/andres-almiray) ([@aalmiray](https://twitter.com/aalmiray))

Andrés gave an interesting overview of the JVM Frameworks ecosystem, starting with some history. He reminded us all when [Struts](https://struts.apache.org/) was the king of the hill, and how it surrendered to [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), Grails, etc. The microservices appeared and the frameworks evolved as well. Spring Boot has been the dominant player for a while but everything changed last year with the appearance of Micronaut. Others are following the approach like [RedHat](https://www.redhat.com) with [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/).
