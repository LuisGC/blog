summary=Some months ago I wrote in the blog about my road trip through the Romantikstraße in Austria. I shared the trip with Agatha and it went great, so we took advantage of the fact that we both had several pending holidays for this year and repeated the experience in two of the most beautiful regions in France: Normandy and Brittany. This post will be a summary of our experience in Normandy and hopefully I'll be able to write a similar one for Brittany.
~~~~~~

As explained in the previous post, I've recently been in Normandy and Brittany with my friend Agatha. After publishing the first part of the trip: [**Normandy: a brief opinionated guide**](/blog/2017/12/Normandy_a_brief_opinionated_guide.html) now I proceed to do the same with Brittany.

It has been quite complicated because we saw a lot of awesome things and for me it still takes a lot of time to write this kind of articles. Let me repeat the disclaimers:

# What to expect from this guide

The trip was decided and confirmed like four or five days before leaving so we couldn't prepare a lot but at least Agatha was able to prepare a list of places to visit in both regions. Specially for Brittany she even made the effort to collect several articles with comments and recommendations of places. Being honest, we could not follow most of them (they were written for other times of the year and other kind of travelers) but it was very helpful anyway.

So, our trip started with many places to visit, a few notes and very few hours of daylight to see things. We had to be very practical and extremely flexible, but in the end almost all the decisions went well so I decided to relate the trip from an opinionated point of view, as I have been asked by several colleagues and friends.

For each place, I'll summarize our experience there with the list of places we visited and some comments on them. There is much more to visit, It is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the essentials of each city or town.

I will not include purely practical info like ticket prices and opening times, it changes a lot and sooner than later it becomes obsolete info. Alas, we were forced to visit some places only during the evening/night with all the museums and attractions closed.

The entire trip was made by car and we booked all our stays in the same day. Normally around 5-6pm and some days even later, the advantages of traveling in the low season.

I'm afraid I'll forget a lot of things, maybe in the next trip I'll choose to be copilot so I can take notes during the trip.
