It has been a week since I returned from another intense and though-provoking weekend in Brussels, although it still feels like it was just yesterday. This year, apart from attending **FOSDEM** (as I intend to do every year) I took a very early flight on Friday to visit new (for me) places in the city. In just one day I visited the [**European Parliament Hemicycle**](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/visiting/en/brussels/briefing-hemicycle-visits), the [**House of European History**](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/visiting/en/brussels/house-of-european-history), the [**Parlamentarium**](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/visiting/en/brussels/parlamentarium) and the [**Museum of Natural Sciences**](https://www.naturalsciences.be/). My most productive Friday in months.

For those of you who don't know [**FOSDEM**](https://fosdem.org/), it is the biggest conference in Europe (and one of the biggest around the world) related to **Open Source** development and communities. It's a huge event with hundreds of talks, workshops, gatherings and stands from all the relevant projects and communities in the **FOSS (Free and Open Source Software)** ecosystem. It's also a marvelous place to do networking, because there are not only representatives of those projects but normally also the technical leaders of them. If you are good with names and faces you can meet and greet a lot of important and interesting people.

I already wrote about it in previous years:

* **FOSDEM 2016**: [Friday](/blog/2016/03/fosdem-2016-friday/), [Saturday](/blog/2016/03/fosdem-2016-saturday/) and [Sunday](/blog/2016/03/fosdem-2016-sunday/)
* **FOSDEM 2018**: [Saturday](/blog/2018/02/fosdem-2018-saturday/) and [Sunday](/blog/2018/02/fosdem-2018-sunday/)

The [numbers of this 2019 edition](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/closing_fosdem/) speak for themselves, improving all the figures from 2018:

* more than 8,000 attendees in only two days
* [730 speakers](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/speakers/) in [788 different events](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/events/) (talks or workshops, mainly)
* [63 tracks](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/rooms/) in 47 different rooms
* [more than 400 hours of content](https://video.fosdem.org/), almost all of the events are [available online with live streaming](https://fosdem.org/2019/schedule/streaming/) during the conference
* [65 stands](https://fosdem.org/2019/stands/) of all kinds of projects: [FSFE](https://fsfe.org/), [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf), [the Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/), [OSI](https://opensource.org/), [the Eclipse Foundation](https://eclipse.org/), [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/), [O'Reilly](http://www.oreilly.com/), [Fedora](http://getfedora.org/), [OpenSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/), [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) [KDE](http://www.kde.org/), [Gnome](http://gnome.org/), [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/), [VideoLAN](https://videolan.org/), [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org/), ...

To make it more impressive, take into account that FOSDEM is **organized by volunteers**, everything is **community driven** and it's **free to attend**. You don't even need to register beforehand.
