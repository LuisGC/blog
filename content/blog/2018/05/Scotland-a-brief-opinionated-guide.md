Some weeks ago I had the pleasure to make an awesome road trip through Scotland with my friend **Agatha**, my travel companion lately. Yo can read about our trips together through [Austria](/blog/2017/05/Romantikstrasse-the-Romantic-Road_1.html), [Brittany](/blog/2017/12/Brittany-a-brief-opinionated-guide.html) or [Normandy](/blog/2017/12/Normandy-a-brief-opinionated-guide.html).

It was my second time in Scotland, after a great trip three years ago to visit mainly Edinburgh. So, this time the Scottish capital was discarded as a destination and the goal was to visit as much as possible of the rest of this beautiful country.

In six days we drove around **a thousand miles** and hiked almost **40 kilometers**, without taking into account the countless walks through cities and towns. And we found [more than 25 caches](https://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=b78f2e04-cd1c-4199-820c-7ea3bb7fea20)!!

# What to expect from this guide

Again (and it's starting to be an issue) we had to prepare the trip in just a few days. Some places were more or less familiar to me and for years I've had a terrible desire to visit the Isle of Skye, but apart from that all the initial research was full of positive surprises.

Let me show you the initial map of Scotland _must visit_ destinations prepared by Agatha, except the Isle of Skye prepared by myself. Sadly we couldn't visit all of those places because we decided to do as much hiking as possible and we took it very easy in general, but we managed to visit almost all of them.

Let's start!

## Day 1, Loch Lomond, Puck's Glen & Oban

We landed at Glasgow International Airport very very soon to make the most out of the first day. We lost some of this advantage struggling with the [car rental company](http://www.easirent.com/). In the end the experience with them was OK but it started horribly bad. They gave us a car smaller than expected (and booked, and payed) but at least it had automatic transmission and in the end it was comfortable enough for two and very appropriate and comfortable to drive on normally one lane roads.

</div>

Our first destination was [**Balloch**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloch,_West_Dunbartonshire), on the southern shore of the beautiful [**Loch Lomond**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_Lomond), the largest inland stretch of water in Great Britain by surface area. We visited the castle gardens and walked through the main road (including our first beers of the trip, mine without alcohol). Balloch is a popular destination because lots of ferries leave from there to navigate the lake. The only ship that we boarded was _The Maid of the Loch_, a beautiful [paddle steamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddle_steamer) (the last to be built in Britain) that is coupled to the pier and serves nowadays as a cafeteria. Apparently is being restored by a charity whose aim is to return her into operation again.

The next stop was [**Luss**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luss), a touristic small town a few kilometers up the lake shore. The center of the town was very beautiful, specially the surroundings of the Parish church, but there was a disproportionate amount of tourists. Before leaving we had a nice lunch in [a quaint restaurant](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4431180826), including the best chicken chipotle wrap that I've ever eaten. Seriously.

After another nice drive through a marvelous countryside we arrived to the starting point of [**Puck's Glen**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puck%27s_Glen), probably the most beautiful walking trail that I've seen. Puck's Glen is amazing, the pictures cannot capture the atmosphere in the whole place. Looks like it's named after the character of [William Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare)'s play [A Midsummer Night's Dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Midsummer_Night%27s_Dream) and it surely resembles a fantastic dream: huge trees, dense forests, breathtaking viewpoints, uncountable water streams, picturesque water falls, steep ravines,... The hike is not very long and it's totally accessible so you should not miss it if you come near the area.

</div>

We finished our first stage near [**Oban**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oban), a beautiful resort town surrounding a nice bay. It has a curious monument on top of a hill, [McCraig's Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCaig%27s_Tower), and lots of restaurants and hotels. Despite this, we chose a promising Bed and Breakfast in a town nearby.

</div>

**Bonus recommendation**: the [Grove House](https://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/grove-guest-house-oban.html) Bed and Breakfast exceeded all our expectations. They were extremely nice with us (including waiting until late for the check-in), gave us two rooms for the same price so we could sleep more comfortably and an impressive breakfast. I took one my favorite breakfasts in the UK: smoked herring grilled.

## Day 2, Beinn Lora, Glen Coe, Loch Ness & Eilean Donan

After the energetic breakfast, the first we did was another small hike, the _Eagle's Eyrie_ walk in **Beinn Lora**. The path had been recently improved by the logging company that exploits the area and it was very beautiful and interesting. Not so many days before everything was covered by huge trees but when we were visited only some remaining lumber and stumps were there. In some stumps we counted more than 60 rings, the entire area produced mixed feelings of sadness and beauty. Very curious, after all.

Some kilometers up north we arrived the main attraction of the day: the [**Glen Coe** National Natural Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Coe), one of the most popular Natural Reserves in the UK. We visited the _Meeting of the Three Waters_ and the _Three Sisters_, totally different things but separated by less than 1 kilometer. Despite the light rain, we decided to start climbing the [_Bidean nam Bian_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidean_nam_Bian) mountain massif to reach the [**Coire Gabhail**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coire_Gabhail), also known as Lost Valley or Hidden Valley because in order to reach this glacier formed marvel you need to climb 230 meters through a steep path. The ascension was fantastic and beautiful, but also very long and quite adventurous because the rain became more intense and the path was very steep and wet. We were always safe but we ended up very tired and soaked after almost 5 hours under the heavy rain. It was totally worth it, anyway.

</div>

After a well deserved lunch at the _Boots Bar_ in the [_Clachaig Inn_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clachaig_Inn), we decided to spend the evening with more relaxed visits, the first of them to [**Fort Augustus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Augustus), a small village in the south west end of [**Loch Ness**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_Ness). It is very popular for tourists but the main attraction is the lake itself. We took the car again to reach the ruins of Urquhart Castle, but it was closed already so we couldn't even enter. I visited it in my previous trip to Scotland, but at least Agatha could see the ruins with the lake behind and _Nessie_ diving somewhere..

The rain continued and the sunset was approaching, so for the rest of our evening we left a quick stop at the [**Eilean Donan Castle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eilean_Donan). The castle has an interesting history but it's private and it was closed, so we just crossed the bridge and walked around it calmly to enjoy the place as we were completely alone.

## Day 3, Isle of Skye

We visited some of the main landmarks and popular hikes in the Isle of Skye,

Our first stop was to climb to the [**Old Man of Storr**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Storr), a picturesque 28 meters high pinnacle surrounded by similar rock structures. Compared to the previous days with the entire paths for us, in this route we met many more people. The parking site was packed full, even in the shoulders of the roam, and the complete path was full of people going up and down. Nevertheless, the climb is beautiful and not very hard, so it's a strong recommendation.

</div>

After lunch, we make a quick stop to see the Mealt Falls, a lake overflowing to the sea almost directly on a cliff. Interesting.

Our next stop was poorly planned and fatally executed, everything because of me. There are several ways to visit [**The Quiraing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiraing) and I choose the worst one starting with the most difficult part, a very steep ascension with lots of mud and puddles. The idea was that the rest of the way would be to descend from there, but the path was not easy even after having passed the worst slopes. A Storm suddenly appeared, we had only a few hours of light and we didn't risk it. After going down to the parking lot, attempting the shortest and easiest path to The Quiraing was not appealing so we went to the next stop.

**Fairy Glen** is a special and curious place to visit. It's a small area formed by small magical hills eroded in _spiral-ish_ waves. To the natural attractive the locals have added more spirals in the ground made with stones and towers of stone in equilibrium.

</div>

After a long drive we arrived before the sunset to the [**Neis Point**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neist_Point), the most westerly point of the Isle. There is a beautiful walk from the car park to the lighthouse, including an interesting ascension to a small summit where you can (supposedly) see whales, dolphins and sharks. But you don't need to climb anything to enjoy a spectacular sunset from almost anywhere in the point.

</div>

As we couldn't book anything more or less affordable in the entire area, we changed our plans and decided to drive a couple of hours after dinner to sleep closer to our next destination outside of Skye instead of spending one additional day around there. We probably failed in that decision, because with the hotel booked far far away and just after starting the trip, it began to rain torrentially. Our GPS's two hour estimate was transformed into almost 4 hours driving under the rain, at night, mostly through 1-lane roads and after a long day driving and hiking.

**Bonus recommendation**: Near the Rubha nam Brathairean on our way to The Quiraing we ate in the [Skye Pie cafe](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4990961322), a cute place with a vegetarian friendly menu that serves mainly pies of spectacular flavors based on local products, including some sweet pies for dessert.
