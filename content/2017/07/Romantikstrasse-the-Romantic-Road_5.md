# Day 5

Our last stage started in [**Obertraun**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obertraun) and ended in **Madrid**. After a fabulous trip around Austria, we decided to spent our last morning in a quite different environment, visiting the [**Mauthausen memorial**](https://www.mauthausen-memorial.org/).

## Mauthausen

The [**Mauthausen concentration camp**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauthausen-Gusen_concentration_camp) (1938-1945) was one of the first massive concentration camps in Nazi Germany, and the last to be liberated by the Allies. The construction started just two weeks after the [**Anschluss**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anschluss), when Austria was annexed into the [Third Reich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Reich). Since the beginning it was labeled as _Stufe III_ (Grade III), which meant that it was intended to be one of the toughest camps, and never lost this horrible classification. Mauthausen was mainly used for incarceration and [extermination through labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extermination_through_labour) of political prisoners, forced to work both in the expansion of the camp itself and in granite quarries nearby. Their daily lives were shaped by hunger, arbitrary violence and death.

The main complex in Mauthausen was declared national memorial site in 1949 and it's also a museum since 1975, 30 years after the camp's liberation.
