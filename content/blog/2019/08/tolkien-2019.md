If you are reading this you probably know already that I am a big fan of [**J.R.R. Tolkien**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien), to the point that I joined the Spanish Tolkien Society ([**Sociedad Tolkien Española**](http://www.sociedadtolkien.org/)) almost 20 years ago and I usually don't miss any of their events.

Since recently I also belong to the [**Tolkien Society**](https://www.tolkiensociety.org/), and after having missed for probably important (but now unknown) reasons [Tolkien 2005 and Tolkien 2012](https://www.tolkiensociety.org/society/events/conferences/), the last major events that they organized, I was not going to miss [**Tolkien 2019**](https://www.tolkien2019.com/). In 2005 the gathering marked the 50th anniversary of the complete publication of The Lord of The Rings. In 2012 the conference was held to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the publication of The Hobbit. This year the **Tolkien Society** celebrated its own 50th anniversary with the largest celebration of Tolkien ever held.

I don't have time right now for a complete review of the event, but I don't want to miss the opportunity to write here some quick impressions of my experience there.

Let me summarize some of the talks and activities I attended:
