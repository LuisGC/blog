Due to the pandemic this year I could not make my yearly pilgrimage to Brussels, but I was still able to attend FOSDEM as it mutated to an online conference for the first time. It has not been the same, but it is still an experience I cannot miss.

For those of you who don't know [**FOSDEM**](https://fosdem.org/), I will keep my usual description. It is the biggest conference in Europe (and one of the biggest around the world) related to **Open Source** development and communities. It's a huge event with hundreds of talks, workshops, gatherings and stands from all the relevant projects and communities in the **FOSS (Free and Open Source Software)** ecosystem. It's also a marvelous place to do networking, because there are not only representatives of those projects but normally also the technical leaders of them. If you are good with names and faces you can meet and greet a lot of important and interesting people.

Being online, this year the interaction was limited to matrix channels in parallel to the live streaming.

I already wrote about it in previous years:

* **FOSDEM 2016**: [Friday](/blog/2016/03/fosdem-2016-friday/), [Saturday](/blog/2016/03/fosdem-2016-saturday/) and [Sunday](/blog/2016/03/fosdem-2016-sunday/)
* **FOSDEM 2018**: [Saturday](/blog/2018/02/fosdem-2018-saturday/) and [Sunday](/blog/2018/02/fosdem-2018-sunday/)
* **FOSDEM 2019**: [Saturday](/blog/2019/02/fosdem-2019-saturday/) and [Sunday](/blog/2019/02/fosdem-2019-sunday/)
* **FOSDEM 2020**: [Saturday and Sunday](/blog/2020/02/fosdem-2020/)

The [numbers of this 2020 edition](https://twitter.com/vishwajeets3/status/1224021852349255682) speak for themselves, improving all the figures from previous years:

To make it more impressive, take into account that FOSDEM is **organized by volunteers**, everything is **community driven** and it's **free to attend**. You don't even need to register beforehand.

As usual, let me summarize some of the talks that I attended (in chronological order):

## Talks

[**Getting the Most from Modern Java**](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/modernjava/), by Simon Ritter

Simon Ritter gave an overview of the most recent updates in the Java language: better switch statements in Java 12, a preview of the text blocks for Java 13, ...

And that's all. **See you (hopefully in Brussels) in FOSDEM 2022!!**
