Any [**Goodreads**](https://www.goodreads.com/) user has access to a yearly report with some statistics and basically the covers of all the books read in one year. In order to have it the user only has to set the books as _read_ and the _read date_ to any time in that year.

Taking advantage of this nice feature I will summarize [My 2018 in Books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2018/12155365) from Goodreads:

* I read **7,224 pages** across **56 books**, a 112% of my 50 books read in 2018 goal
* The average length was **129 pages**
* My average rating was **3.7** (up to 5)
* The longest book I read was [_Patria_](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patria_(novel)), by [**Fernando Aramburu**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Aramburu)

The amount of works is not very important (because some of the 56 are comics or short stories) but still 56 books means almost 5 books per month, that translates to one book per week approximately. Not bad, taking into account the other million things that I do (or intend to do) every week.

I'm not copying here the full list, [friend me on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12155365-luis) if you are curious, but at least I want to highlight some of them.

I have included in the ranking three books by [**Juan Gómez Jurado**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_G%C3%B3mez-Jurado), including the Top 1, so he deserves to be in the featured image of the post obtained from <a href='https://www.laopiniondemalaga.es/cultura-espectaculos/2018/11/23/prohibo-terminantemente-leais-entrevista/1049352.html'>La Opinión de Málaga</a>.

I'm currently reading [El Emblema del Traidor](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13086272-el-emblema-del-traidor) also by Juan but when I finish it I will begin my 2019 reading **again** books by or about [**J.R.R. Tolkien**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien). I miss it.
