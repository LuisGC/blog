## Retrospective

I will organize again the analysis in categories, as the time I spent in RPG or video games is becoming much more relevant.

### Boardgames

* In 2020 I have played more than in the previous years, and mainly to long games.
* I recorded 62 gaming sessions, more than 5 per month, to just 20 different games.
* My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index"><b><i>h-index</i></b></a> as a player is now <b>12</b>. I expected to raise it this year, as I have played intensively to a few games.
* I have played 48 scenarios of [**Gloomhaven**](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/174430/gloomhaven) in 41 sessions. That is more than half the games I've played in the whole year. I love it, and perhaps I should write a spoiler free post in the blog about it.

### Role-playing games

* With just 8 sessions, mostly online due to the pandemic, we closed in June our [Storm King's Thunder](https://rpggeek.com/rpgitem/203811/storm-kings-thunder) campaign for [**Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition**](https://rpggeek.com/rpg/17181/dungeons-dragons-5th-edition).
* For the moment, we haven't started a new campaign, with D&D or not, but I hope we will be able to do it as soon as the situation allows it.

### Video games

* This year I have played more video games than ever, for sure.
* In [**Steam**](https://store.steampowered.com/) I have played:
  - Mostly [**Tabletop Simulator**](https://steamcommunity.com/app/286160). I have more than 150h only from 2020.
  - I played for a while to [**This War of Mine**](https://steamcommunity.com/app/282070). Interesting and challenging, I will probably play again when in the proper mood.
  - I finished [**Firewatch**](https://steamcommunity.com/app/383870). An intense and well written story. Some passages ended up being too repetitive but the game is short overall.
  - I completed [**The Darkside Detective**](https://steamcommunity.com/app/368390). Interesting and challenging puzzles, good laughs with a nice design and a fantastic retro based characters and stories.
* In January I bought a second hand Playstation 4 from a colleague (without knowing about covid-19 yet) and since April I used it a lot. I have completed:
  - [**Marvel's Spiderman**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(2018_video_game)). The positive things make the negative ones irrelevant. It's just awesome to swing around Manhattan and I spent hours just doing it.
  - [**Journey**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_(2012_video_game)). Cute and short game, and both things deserve recognition sometimes. Perhaps too short but take it or leave it.
  - [**The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_3:_Wild_Hunt). Dozens of hours, my favourite game so far. Some side quests are repetitive but in general I engaged a lot with the character. Being a huge fan of the novels also helps, but it's not a requirement to enjoy the game. I played Witcher 1 and 2 just to play this, and it was totally worth it.
  - [**Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted:_The_Nathan_Drake_Collection), including [Uncharted: Drake's Fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted:_Drake%27s_Fortune), [Uncharted 2: Among Thieves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_2:_Among_Thieves) and [Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_3:_Drake%27s_Deception). Being a completists, I need to play (if I can) all the saga. After having played (and loved) several Tomb Raider games, this was a perfect match for me and I was not disappointed.
  - [**Call of Duty: Black Ops III**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Black_Ops_III). I only played the campaign, only single player and no zombie scenarios. Having said that, I liked it and perhaps I could play it again.
  - [**Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Infinite_Warfare). I enjoyed the spaceship missions and the overall campaign story, but as I played it just after Black Ops III, it was too repetitive sometimes.
  - [**Mass Effect: Andromeda**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect:_Andromeda). My first interaction with Mass Effect, and I liked it a lot. Dozens of hours to avoid leaving any single rock unturned, and it was worth it.
  - [**Dragon Age Inquisition**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Age:_Inquisition). My first interaction with Dragon Age, and it is not going to be the last one. It reminded me sometimes to [Pillars of Eternity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillars_of_Eternity) and [Baldur's Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate), but the story is perhaps  more solid and the overall atmosphere is more dramatic. The only thing that I disliked was all the gear evolution related parts, it was confusing and often useless.
* Despite having a new PlayStation, I have tried to play in [**Stadia**](https://stadia.google.com/) as well, as a PRO subscriber. I haven't used the subscription so I finally cancelled it. In 2020 I played.
  - [**Destiny 2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_2), I like the game and I've spent several hours but I haven't engaged yet with it.
  - [**Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year celebration**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_of_the_Tomb_Raider). Only with the opening scene I know I will play it again in the future. It's probably my favorite Tomb Raider game and I love all of them.
  - [**Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Jedi:_Fallen_Order). I bought it with a discount without removing my subscription as it looked like an _Uncharted_ game in the Star Wars universe, and it's more or less like this. I enjoyed being a Jedi and learning to be one, but I didn't like the lack of fast travel. Exploration it's a big part of the game, and it's nice and challenging, but once you get lost in a labyrinth a few times it starts to piss you off. The end is awesome, that's for sure.
  - Either on Steam, PS4 or Stadia, I plan to keep playing as much as I can also this year. Perhaps eventually in PS5, who knows?
