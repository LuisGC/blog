Some months ago I wrote in the blog about [my road trip through the Romantikstraße in Austria](/blog/2017/05/Romantikstrasse-the-Romantic-Road_1.html). I shared the trip with Agatha and it went great, so we took advantage of the fact that we both had several pending holidays for this year and repeated the experience in two of the most beautiful regions in France: Normandy and Brittany. This post will be a summary of our experience in Normandy and hopefully I'll be able to write a similar one for Brittany.

# What to expect from this guide

The trip was decided and confirmed like four or five days before leaving so we couldn't prepare a lot but at least Agatha was able to prepare a list of places to visit in both regions. Specially for Brittany she even made the effort to collect several articles with comments and recommendations of places. Being honest, we could not follow most of them (they were written for other times of the year and other kind of travelers) but it was very helpful anyway.

So, our trip started with many places to visit, a few notes and very few hours of daylight to see things. We had to be very practical and extremely flexible, but in the end almost all the decisions went well so I decided to relate the trip from an opinionated point of view, as I have been asked by several colleagues and friends.

For each place, I'll summarize our experience there with the list of places we visited and some comments on them. There is much more to visit, It is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the essentials of each city or town.

I will not include purely practical info like ticket prices and opening times, it changes a lot and sooner than later it becomes obsolete info. Alas, we were forced to visit some places only during the evening/night with all the museums and attractions closed.

The entire trip was made by car and we booked all our stays in the same day. Normally around 5-6pm and some days even later, the advantages of traveling in the low season.

I'm afraid I'll forget a lot of things, maybe in the next trip I'll choose to be copilot so I can take notes during the trip.

Let's start!

## Rouen

After landing in Charles de Gaulle around 3pm, we picked the rental car and our first destination was [Rouen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouen), capital city of Normandy. The city is known for its gorgeous downtown, its famous gothic Cathedral and for being the place where [Joan of Arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_of_Arc) was burned at the stake.

We arrived later than expected so everything was closed. The Cathedral was supposed to be open (according to the web) but it wasn't. Luckily in front of the cathedral there was a Christmas Market so we had our first vin chaud to warm ourselves for a walk the town center

Places we visited:

- **Notre Dame Cathedral** Huge and awesome, specially from the outside
- **Gros Horloge**, a fourteenth-century two-sides astronomical clock, not as spectacular as the one in Prague, for example, but you should not miss it as it's close to the Cathedral
- **Place du Vieux Marché** and the **Church of St Joan of Arc**. Joan of Arc was burned alive for heresy in this square in 1431, there is a small memorial with a huge cross marking the spot. The church was completed in 1979, quite modern but the place it's very interesting. The stained glass windows are from the 16th century, retrieved from other church, and the building itself its worth the visit. It's very long, crossing almost entirely the square, and evokes both flames and an overturned ship. There is also an interesting gourmet market beside the church, following the same design
- **Church of St Maclou**, this 15th century gothic temple is much smaller than the other touristic temples but in my opinion it's the most quaint one. also, the best streets to find a good place to eat or drink (as a resident told us) are the ones surrounding St Maclou.
- **Church of Saint Ouen**, the largest gothic temple of Rouen that started as an abbey church but was vacated and it serves now other purposes as part of the Town Hall. When we entered, there was an organ concert and a moder art exposition.
- **Aître Saint-Maclou**, It is one of the rarest ossuaries remaining in Europe. It's origin as a normal cemetery dates back to the Black Death. After a new epidemic in the 16th century it became necessary to increase its capacity so they build galleries with several rooms to contain the bones.
- Other interesting places we couldn't visit properly: the **Musée des Beaux-Arts**, the **Musée Le Secq des Tournelles** and the **Tower of Jean of Arc**

## The Normandy Abbeys Trail

This interesting trail starts with the Church of Saint-Ouen in Rouen, and continues near the city following down the course of the Seine River.

- **Saint-Georges Abbey** in Saint-Martin-de-Boscherville, sadly it was closed so we couldn't enter (not even the gardens) but there is a remarkable bakery that compensated us
- **Jumièges Abbey**
- **Saint-Wandrille Abbey**
