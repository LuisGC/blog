Any [**Goodreads**](https://www.goodreads.com/) user has access to a yearly report with some statistics and basically the covers of all the books read in one year. In order to have it the user only has to set the books as _read_ and the _read date_ to any time in that year. Taking advantage of this nice feature I will summarize [My 2019 in Books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2019/12155365) from Goodreads, as I did one year ago for [my read books in 2018](/blog/2019/01/my-year-2018-in-books/).

## My 2019 in numbers

* I read **7,878 pages** across **57 books**, a 114% of my 50 books read in 2019 goal
* That's **20 novels** (not taking into account comics or short stories)
* The average length was **138 pages**
* My average rating was **3.6** (up to 5)
* The longest book I read was my nth reading of [The Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings), by [**J.R.R. Tolkien**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien)

The featured image goes to [Nnedi Okorafor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nnedi_Okorafor), as my main discovery of the year after reading her [Binti trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binti_(novel)). She has won a Hugo, a Nebula, a World Fantasy Award and a Locus Award.

I'm not copying here the full list, [friend me on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12155365-luis) if you are curious, but at least I want to highlight some of them.
