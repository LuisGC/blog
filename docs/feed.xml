      	<description>
	&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I had the immense pleasure of making a road trip through Austria following what they call the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.romantikstrasse.at/es/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romantikstraße&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Romantic Road&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Romantic Trail&lt;/em&gt; in English. Interestingly, ours was a &lt;strong&gt;singles&lt;/strong&gt; trip initially planned for three friends but sadly in the end we were only two because at the last minute Roberto had to cancel. I shared this great adventure only with &lt;strong&gt;Agatha&lt;/strong&gt; and it was great (as expected). I suppose that in the eyes of any innkeeper or bartender we were a happy couple celebrating something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I didn&apos;t notice any special &lt;em&gt;romantic atmosphere&lt;/em&gt; beyond the surrounding beautiful landscapes, fantastic lakes and awesome mountains. Some might say that my sense of romanticism is broken, and it may be possible, but for me Nature is not romantic by itself. Luckily the shops, restaurants and villages in general didn&apos;t focus on selling this concept to the visitors. In fact it was very unlikely to find a sign about the Romantikstraße off the main roads of the route. But enough talking about the commercial name of the route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me summarize our experience, mainly anecdotes and tips. Prices, timetables and other General tourist information are easy to find and that info sometimes expires soon. I&apos;ll love to read it in the future and it could be useful for anyone planning a similar trip. You can also read &lt;a href=&quot;https://detintasuelta.blogspot.com.es/2017/05/romantikstrasse-por-austria.html&quot;&gt;Agatha&apos;s review in her blog&lt;/a&gt; (in Spanish). She &lt;a href=&quot;https://detintasuelta.blogspot.com.es/2017/02/preparando-la-romantikstrasse-por.html&quot;&gt;prepared the route perfectly in advance&lt;/a&gt; and we mainly followed her plan, we only needed a couple of improvised detours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The area covered by the Romantikstraße is totally amazing. &lt;strong&gt;Everything is beautiful&lt;/strong&gt;, looks shiny, deserves a zillion pictures or to sit for a while to admire the landscape. Especially the latter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It&apos;s &lt;strong&gt;not a cheap trip&lt;/strong&gt;, but it&apos;s not as expensive as Switzerland&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We spent 4,5 days there and it was enough but the trip &lt;strong&gt;deserves at least a couple days more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hallstatt is very beautiful, but it&apos;s not (as they claim) the &lt;strong&gt;most beautiful village in the world&lt;/strong&gt;. Covarrubias is (of course)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Preparing the Romantikstraße&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not as lucky as I was and you need to prepare the trip in advance, my first recommendation is to visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.romantikstrasse.at/en/&quot;&gt;official website of the Romantikstraße&lt;/a&gt;. There you&apos;ll find a lot of info about the route and the main attractions. You can also request a brochure of the route in several languages for free, we did it and it was useful during the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the accommodation, depending on the dates of the trip it may be essential to book everything in advance. Some villages are very small and have few options to choose from. We booked in advance only the first night and a couple of nights we needed a considerable detour from the route, and it was low season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Day 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Schallaburg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After wasting more than 1 hour in the airport waiting the queue of the car rental company our first destination was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schallaburg.at/en?set_language=en&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schallaburg Castle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a &amp;gt;900 years old castle very well preserved located on top of a hill surrounded by forest. In addition to the privileged situation, the castle offers a very well arranged garden. This first stop reminded me of my bicycle trip through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cycling-loire.com/&quot;&gt;La Loire à Vélo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The castle also hosts temporal exibitions and a very nice restaurant in the courtyard called &lt;em&gt;Schloss&lt;/em&gt;. Apart from the regional specialities, the restaurant changes it&apos;s menu and decoration to match the running exibitions. During our visit the main exhibition was about Islam and we could acclimitize to the country with a regional craft beer and some falafel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first funny anecdote of the trip arrived soon. From the parking to the castle we saw two different roads, both very steep. Ignoring a medium-sized sign in german we followed the nearest of them, because in &lt;a href=&quot;http://osmand.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OSMAnd&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I could see that it was more direct to the gardens and the castle. After visiting the garden, the courtyard of the castle, the restaurant and most of the open rooms (and some closed ones), we noticed that we had paid nothing to be there. We went back to the parking lot using the other way and confirmed that we&apos;d skipped the ticket office. I leave to your imagination if we warned them of our mistake and paid the entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before leaving, we found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=dc7d5446-009c-4332-8fde-2881d06a4882&quot;&gt;our first cache of the trip&lt;/a&gt;, less than 5 meters from our car :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Melk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next visit was to Melk and his famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melk_Abbey&quot;&gt;Melk Abbey&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umberto_Eco&quot;&gt;Umberto Eco&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;em&gt;Adso de Melk&lt;/em&gt; as a tribute to this abbey, and we were curious about it and the fact that the Austrians talk about this place as one of the most important monasteries in Europe. The place did not dissapoint us at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did a quick tour through the main elements of this baroque Abbey. The exhibition, the Marble Hall and the church are quite beautiful but what really impressed us was the Library, with about 100.000 volumes (1.888 manuscripts, 750 incunabula, a unique 13th century copy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibelungenlied&quot;&gt;The Song of the Nibelungs&lt;/a&gt;, ...). In one room of the Library the fresco portrays an allegory of Scientia (Science), just like churches in Spain, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2017/05/Melk_Abbey_Library.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Melk Abbey Library&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Abbey was also wisely located, on top of a hill and clearly standing out from the town of Melk. The visit is worth it just for the views from the balcony connecting the Marble Hall and the Library with Melk, the Danube river and forests everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visit to the Abbey includes a nice English landscape garden with an interesting baroque pavilion and a small park full of works of art and fabulous hidden corners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t forget to find &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5X2KR_tb-hotel-der-kescherinnen?guid=7e33fa4c-f4a2-4ac9-b11a-ee13d2db9a03&quot;&gt;this awesome cache&lt;/a&gt; in the surrounding area. One of my all time favorites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Steyr&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our last stop for the first day was Steyr, where (as they say) &lt;em&gt;Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo meet each other in harmony&lt;/em&gt;. Steyr is in the confluence of the rivers Enns and Steyr, and therefore features more than 100 bridges. I confess that I expected to hear the comment &lt;em&gt;The Venice of Austria&lt;/em&gt; but it didn&apos;t happen. The old town is nice, all around the huge Stadtplatz (market square) that was, saldy, partially ocuppied with parked cars and even some tents for private events. Disgusting for the visitors and I&apos;d bet that also for the locals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image lateral&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2017/05/Steyr_Nachtwachtern.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Steyr&apos;s Nachtwachtern&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Steyr&apos;s Nachtwachtern - &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;CC BY-NC-SA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our main goal in this city was to follow the &lt;strong&gt;Nachtwächtern Tour&lt;/strong&gt;, a walking tour through the old town guided by a historian disguised as medieval watchman. Unluckily the tour was only in german, and we struggled to get the guide to understand that we wanted to follow him without understanding anything at all. The guide took pity on us, letting us follow him paying &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; half the price. As expected we didn&apos;t understand anything, but we crossed the same streets and alleys, we looked where they looked, we analyzed in detail whatever they commented in detail, and we laughed when they laughed (maybe even some joke about Spanish tourists, who knows).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Night Watchman Tour is also the only way for a tourist to climb the 228 steps of the &lt;strong&gt;Stadtpfarrkirche Steyr&lt;/strong&gt; tower, a roman catholic Church dedicated to Saint Aegidius (I toast him!) and Saint Koloman. Even at night, the views are wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a delicious dinner with local specialities at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/270488531&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mader&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and returned to our guest house (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3119352500&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gasthof Bauer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). I recommend both places but especially the second one, the guest house ocuppied several low buildings and houses in a small island near the old town, the rooms were almost small apartments and the attention we received was exquisite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep tuned for next episodes!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Baking my Blog with JBake and GitHub</title>
      <link>https://luisgc.github.io/blog/2017/05/baking-my-blog-with-JBake-and-Github.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 May 2017 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">2017/05/baking-my-blog-with-JBake-and-Github.html</guid>
      	<description>
	&lt;p&gt;Almost since &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2003/10/arranca-luiyologa.html&quot;&gt;I created my personal blog&lt;/a&gt; in 2003 I thought about moving it from blogger to my own domain, private hosting and so on. My lazyness prevented me from doing so. Not because the migration itself, but for the maintenance it entailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I was determined to migrate my blog outside of any blogging platform. I wanted to have complete control over my content, but without wasting lots of time in maintenance. All I needed was a way to do it seamlessly, quickly, and as automated as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The static site/blog generators appeared a long time ago but now they are multiplying and flourishing. I watched them and the surrounding tools for a long time... and recently my atheist prayers were heard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will describe briefly what I did &lt;strong&gt;to move my blog from blogger to Github Pages in a few hours&lt;/strong&gt;. The most time consuming task was to decide among a large number of excellent static site generators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1 - Choose your weapon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reference here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.staticgen.com/&quot;&gt;StaticGen&lt;/a&gt;, a ranking with all the open source static site generators. The site itself is open source, and static generated (of course) using &lt;a href=&quot;http://middlemanapp.com/&quot;&gt;Middleman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;StaticGen&lt;/em&gt; you will need some time, filtering by programming language, sorting the options by stars, forks, ... Eventually you&apos;ll chose one that covers your needs mainly in terms of language, templating technology or license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was tempted to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://gohugo.io/&quot;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; but I selected &lt;a href=&quot;http://jbake.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JBake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (created in 2013 by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jonathanbullock.com/&quot;&gt;Jonathan Bullock&lt;/a&gt;) instead of other much more popular options. The main reasons for me were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It&apos;s &lt;strong&gt;Open Source&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT&quot;&gt;MIT License&lt;/a&gt;). This is always the first element in my checklist&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It&apos;s &lt;strong&gt;cross platform&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the main benefits to choose a product running in the JVM, right?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supports a good amount of &lt;strong&gt;content formats&lt;/strong&gt;: plain HTML, &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://asciidoctor.org/&quot;&gt;AsciiDoc&lt;/a&gt;, ... this is great now that I write even my personal notes in markdown format&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interesting &lt;strong&gt;template support&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://freemarker.org/&quot;&gt;Freemarker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thymeleaf.org/&quot;&gt;Thymeleaf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/neuland/jade4j&quot;&gt;Jade&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.groovy-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Groovy template framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blog-ready&lt;/strong&gt; out of the box: RSS feed, tag support, archive, index pagination, ...&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easy to integrate with &lt;strong&gt;CSS frameworks&lt;/strong&gt; as &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbootstrap.com/&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Custom metadata&lt;/strong&gt; in the contents, even exposed to the templates. This is winner by itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://jbake.org/docs/&quot;&gt;documentation of JBake&lt;/a&gt; could be improved, but it&apos;s good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install JBake, you can execute &lt;a href=&quot;http://jbake.org/download.html&quot;&gt;the last binary distribution&lt;/a&gt; but I recommend that you simply use &lt;a href=&quot;http://sdkman.io/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SDKMAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If you don&apos;t know what SDKMAN is, you are missing something special. After you have SDKMAN installed, enter the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sdk install jbake
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks Jonathan !!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2 - Choose your theme/style&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some static generators support themes better than others, that&apos;s for sure. This was important to me, and I checked that in &lt;em&gt;JBake&lt;/em&gt; the code responsible of the presentation is isolated enough from the content, so it&apos;s more or less simple to change entirely the theme or style of your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I didn&apos;t start the personalization of my blog from the default theme and style. I cloned the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/manikmagar/jbake-future-imperfect-template&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JBake Future Imperfect Template&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/manikmagar&quot;&gt;Manik Magar&lt;/a&gt; and for the moment I&apos;ve only needed minor touches to make it better suited for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As simple as this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; mkdir awesome-jbake

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; git clone https://github.com/manikmagar/jbake-future-imperfect-template.git awesome-jbake

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; cd awesome-jbake &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ls -ltr
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the changes were related to custom css styles that I was already using in Blogger, the &lt;em&gt;JBake Future Imperfect Template&lt;/em&gt; is fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks Manik !!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 3 - Migrate your content from your old blog/site (if needed)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&apos;ll only need this if you are migrating something, skip this point if you are creating something from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this magic trick, my first intent was to implement it myself, only to code for a while. Finally I discovered a repo in github with a promising name: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cloudtu/blogger-to-jbake&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blogger-to-jbake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I checked the code and the author (&lt;a href=&quot;http://cloudtu.github.io/&quot;&gt;Cloud Tu&lt;/a&gt;) had developed more or less what I meant to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a little help from an &lt;em&gt;difficult-even-for-google-translate&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;README&lt;/code&gt; file in Chinese, I could run the program and export all my blog only with minor problems regarding the download of certain images that were not hosted in blogger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steps are very simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Modify the &lt;code&gt;src/main/resources/application.properties&lt;/code&gt; to set the Blogger atom file path, the output path and your current URL in Blogger&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Execute &lt;code&gt;gradlew run&lt;/code&gt; in the console&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Profit!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made some improvements (from my humble point of view) in the code, and I&apos;ll send the corresponding pull request. They could be valuable for anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks Cloud Tu !!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 4 - Deploy your blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, thanks to Github and specifically to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;, the only thing that I needed was to change the configuration of JBake so the output directory for the &lt;em&gt;baked&lt;/em&gt; content is called &lt;code&gt;docs&lt;/code&gt; instead of the name by default (&lt;code&gt;output&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/&quot;&gt;enabling it for the first time&lt;/a&gt;, Github automatically deploys in Github Pages whatever you put in the &lt;code&gt;docs&lt;/code&gt; directory of your repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m suffering the misbehaviour of Github Pages with relative paths, but for the moment I&apos;m solving it with a sed command before pushing the baked content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks Github Pages !!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m happier than ever with my blog, and I&apos;ll try to write more often now that I can make it with my editor in Markdown or AsciiDoc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s also possible that I&apos;ll write a more technical post about how JBake works, but in the meantime ask me in the comments anything that you want to know.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;i&gt;I&apos;ll keep my intent to summarize all the important events that I&apos;m attending, and I&apos;ll do it again in English as the audience is international. &lt;b&gt;Please, point me any mistake you may find&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;a href=&quot;http://2017.greachconf.com/&quot;&gt;Greach 2017&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I attended, as usual since I don&apos;t remember when, to &lt;a href=&quot;http://2017.greachconf.com/&quot;&gt;Greach 2017&lt;/a&gt;, an international conference about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.groovy-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Apache Groovy language&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.groovy-lang.org/ecosystem.html&quot;&gt;ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;. Greach is held each year in Madrid but everything is in English, and nowadays it&apos;s probably one of the Top3 worldwide events about this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event is organized mainly by &lt;a href=&quot;http://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&amp;amp;jsonp=vglnk_149113158632914&amp;amp;key=fc09da8d2ec4b1af80281370066f19b1&amp;amp;libId=j10kgw3v01012xfw000DLef6729tbp6er&amp;amp;loc=http%3A%2F%2Fluiyo.blogspot.com.es%2F2016%2F04%2Fgreach-2016-groovy-spanish-conference.html&amp;amp;v=1&amp;amp;out=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Filopmar&amp;amp;title=Luiyolog%C3%ADa%3A%20Greach%202016%2C%20the%20Groovy%20Spanish%20conference&amp;amp;txt=%3Cb%3EIv%C3%A1n%20L%C3%B3pez%3C%2Fb%3E%20(%40ilopar)&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Iván López&lt;/b&gt; (@ilopar)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&amp;amp;jsonp=vglnk_149113160190015&amp;amp;key=fc09da8d2ec4b1af80281370066f19b1&amp;amp;libId=j10kgw3v01012xfw000DLef6729tbp6er&amp;amp;loc=http%3A%2F%2Fluiyo.blogspot.com.es%2F2016%2F04%2Fgreach-2016-groovy-spanish-conference.html&amp;amp;v=1&amp;amp;out=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Falbertovilches&amp;amp;title=Luiyolog%C3%ADa%3A%20Greach%202016%2C%20the%20Groovy%20Spanish%20conference&amp;amp;txt=%3Cb%3EAlberto%20Vilches%3C%2Fb%3E%20(%40albertovilches)&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alberto Vilches&lt;/b&gt; (@albertovilches)&lt;/a&gt;, with some help from other colleagues and &lt;a href=&quot;http://2017.greachconf.com/#tile_sponsors&quot;&gt;a lot of Sponsors&lt;/a&gt;. Everything was perfect: the location is great, the spaces were confortable, the wifi more or less worked fine, cafeteria in-place, free wardrobe,... the lunch boxes were far from perfect, but that&apos;s another story more related to the venue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TLDR;&lt;/b&gt; The conference content and speakers were great, in addition to the logistics. I missed the workshop day, but everyone told me it was also fantastic (both venue and contents). I learned a lot, not only about Groovy or Grails, but also about GraphQL, Ratpack and concurrence in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me summarize some of the talks I attended:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2017.greachconf.com/sessions/make-concurrency-groovy-again/&quot;&gt;Make concurrency groovy again&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href=&quot;http://2017.greachconf.com/speakers/alonso-torres/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alonso Torres&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alotor&quot;&gt;@alotor&lt;/a&gt;). Alonso gave an excellent overview of the main available resources regarding concurrence in the Groovy ecosystem, comparing some of them in terms of design, code readability and even performance. Threads, functional style resources, parallel collections, Atomic variables, fork/join, GPars, actors... and even how to steal a bit from others (Clojure, Akka or Spark) thanks to the Java bindings. Take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/alotor/greach-17-make-concurrency-groovy-again&quot;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Another hands-on master class by Iván, combining and comparing some of the benefits of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.javaslang.io/&quot;&gt;Javaslang&lt;/a&gt; with what&apos;s available out-of-the-box in Groovy. The demo part (90% of the talk) covered a lot of interesting examples: Optional vs Option, Try, Functional Interfaces, Tuples, Javaslang collections, Pattern matching, validations, ...&lt;/li&gt;

Noam gave a complete review of the features included in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/http-builder-ng/http-builder-ng&quot;&gt;HTTP Builder NG&lt;/a&gt;, the current available implementations and some advanced features and use cases like header parsers, content parsers, request interceptors or request encoders&lt;/li&gt;

Burt gave this talk for the first time in 2010 at the Spring One, pointing out some performance problems when mapping collections with any ORM tool (like GORM or Hibernate). After seven years, he revisited the topic repeating (sadly) the same warnings about more or less the same problems, some of them critical with huge data collections&lt;/li&gt;

Thanks to Mario now I have a clear view of what &lt;a href=&quot;http://graphql.org/&quot;&gt;GraphQL&lt;/a&gt; provides, and specially what it does not provide. He reviewed the main features, the logic behind schemas, types querying, hierarchy, operations, the introspective nature of GraphQL... Mario also demoed some useful combination of GraphQL with tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/graphql/graphiql&quot;&gt;GraphiQL&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/relay/&quot;&gt;Relay&lt;/a&gt;. He even teased &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/grooviter/gql&quot;&gt;GQL&lt;/a&gt;, his own DSL library to use GraphQL directly from Groovy. Awesome :-)&lt;/li&gt;

The anual &lt;a href=&quot;https://grails.org/&quot;&gt;Grails&lt;/a&gt; keynote in Greach, in which Graeme showed what came with Grails 3.2 (improvements in the awesome JSON views, in profiles, GORM 6, ...) and what will come with Grails 3.3: GORM 6.1 (already available independently), Spring Boot 1.5.x and Hibernate 5.2. Regarding &lt;a href=&quot;http://gorm.grails.org/&quot;&gt;GORM&lt;/a&gt;, the main things for the 6.1 version are: Improvements in common AST transforms, common services, and Data Services, package scanning and a better mapping DSL. Graeme showed some of the new features and they looked amazing, very good work :-)&lt;/li&gt;

Marcin gave us some tips to make a better use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gebish.org/&quot;&gt;Geb&lt;/a&gt;, starting with the reminder that a Module is a Navigator, that Navigators are iterable, and the advantages of overloading some methods, having dynamic base urls or page parametrizations. He also explained how to inject Javascript into pages (if needed). Other best practices: using strongly typed Geb code, tracking the current page type, always keep the &lt;i&gt;at&lt;/i&gt; checks simple and quick and that modules are not meant only for reuse but also to isolate complex blocks.&lt;/li&gt;

Danny went beyond the basic concepts of concurrency in a fantastic code-driven talk, showing a lot of good examples about the complexity of this kind of problems. He explained how &lt;a href=&quot;https://ratpack.io/&quot;&gt;Ratpack&lt;/a&gt; comes to the rescue, how the Ratpack concept of Promise works, how to manage them and how to test complex concurrent execution flows. Very complete for 45 minutes and very well presented. Homework: read about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html&quot;&gt;the C10K problem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/&quot;&gt;the Disruptor pattern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Como cada arranque de año toca revisar los datos sobre las partidas que he jugado durante el año anterior (enlace a los datos de &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2016/01/mi-2015-ludico.html&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/01/mi-2014-ludico.html&quot;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2014/01/partidas-jugadas-en-2013.html&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2013/01/partidas-jugadas-en-2012.html&quot;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt; y &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/01/juegos-los-que-mas-he-jugado-en-2011.html&quot;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;).

  Partidas Jugadas por Mes hasta 2016
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Análisis:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Este 2016 he jugado más que en los dos años anteriores, aunque no tengo esa sensación porque el número de sesiones es parecido (30 en 2015 vs &lt;b&gt;35&lt;/b&gt; en 2016)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;En 2016 he probado 25 juegos nuevos, siguen siendo bastantes pero una proporción mucho menor que otros años. Se nota que he repetido mucho a algunos juegos (casi un tercio de las partidas fueron a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic&quot;&gt;Pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161936/pandemic-legacy-season-1&quot;&gt;Pandemic Legacy&lt;/a&gt; o &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames&quot;&gt;Código Secreto&lt;/a&gt;). Bastante en línea con las &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1697948/bgg-2016-end-year-stats-plays&quot;&gt;estadísticas globales sobre partidas jugadas que publicó la BGG hace unos días&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;La experiencia con &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161936/pandemic-legacy-season-1&quot;&gt;la temporada 1 de Pandemic Legacy&lt;/a&gt; está siendo fabulosa. Cada vez juego más a cooperativos y cada vez me atraen más los juegos que permiten cierta repetición y continuación a base de reglas &lt;i&gt;legacy&lt;/i&gt; o campañas en general&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Aparte de lo relativo a juegos de mesa y rol, durante 2016 tengo registradas más de &lt;b&gt;150h&lt;/b&gt; en &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Steam&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (de un total de 393.3h). Es altamente improbable que en 2017 pueda mantener esas cifras (de hecho, apenas juego desde el verano pasado)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Como dato nuevo en este análisis, mi &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;h-index&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; como jugador ha subido a &lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt; después de unos años estancado en 10. Dato curioso, aunque poco útil :-P&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Retrospectiva:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Si mi tiempo de ocio ya era limitado en 2016... este año que comienza será peor aún. Veremos qué tal lo voy llevando&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Sigo sin haber podido retomar la campaña que dirigía con &lt;a href=&quot;http://rpggeek.com/rpg/4395/one-ring&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;El Anillo Único&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, y tampoco he podido comenzar a dirigir partidas nuevas a &lt;a href=&quot;http://rpggeek.com/rpg/10154/aventuras-en-la-marca-del-este&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aventuras en la Marca del Este&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; o &lt;a href=&quot;http://rpggeek.com/rpg/21555/baker-street-rpg&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Baker Street RPG&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. En 2017 debería intentar hacer algo al respecto&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Siguiendo la triste dinámica que comencé el año pasado, este año no he jugado apenas a prototipos. Sigo perteneciendo a la &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asociacionludo.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Asociación Ludo&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pero ni pude ir al &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asociacionludo.com/blog/2015/02/10/encuentro-de-protos-y-tipos-2015/&quot;&gt;IV Encuentro de Protos y Tipos&lt;/a&gt; ni he podido ir las reuniones con los compañeros de Madrid. Lo hecho mucho de menos pero por desgracia sigue sin ser prioritario ahora mismo :-(&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <guid isPermaLink="false">2016/11/codemotion-2016.html</guid>
      	<description>
	
&lt;p&gt;Para mantener la &lt;i&gt;buena costumbre&lt;/i&gt; (ya, lo sé, no siempre cumplo), voy a relatar brevemente mi experiencia durante &lt;a href=&quot;https://2016.codemotion.es/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Codemotion 2016&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, uno de los eventos sobre informática y programación más importantes del país. No hay números oficiales definitivos pero en la clausura la organización comentó que hubo &lt;b&gt;más de 2.000 asistentes&lt;/b&gt; y &lt;b&gt;más de 150 charlas/talleres&lt;/b&gt;. Suelo asistir todos los años, hay otros eventos más potentes e interesantes para tecnologías concretas pero como evento generalista donde puedes ver y oír de todo creo que Codemotion hoy en día no tiene rival (al menos en España).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TLDR;&lt;/b&gt; Después de haber dado &lt;b&gt;dos&lt;/b&gt; charlas el año pasado en &lt;a href=&quot;https://2015.codemotion.es/&quot;&gt;Codemotion 2015&lt;/a&gt; este año me lo tomé con mucha tranquilidad. Disfruté de muy buenas charlas (otras no tanto, lo normal) y en general me fui con buen sabor de boca. &lt;b&gt;Nota positiva&lt;/b&gt; para la organización: hubo menos atascos en los pasillos y menos problemas de aforo en las salas. &lt;b&gt;Nota negativa&lt;/b&gt;: sigue sin haber suficiente presencia de mujeres ponentes en el evento y la gestión del tema sigue dejando bastante que desear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leyendo las crónicas de otros asistentes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://codeurjc.wordpress.com/2016/11/21/mi-experiencia-en-codemotion-2016/&quot;&gt;la de &lt;b&gt;Micael Gallego&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, por ejemplo) me doy cuenta una vez más de que no hago suficiente networking en estos eventos. Es una pena no aprovechar la ocasión, me crucé con mucha gente conocida: antiguos compañeros, conocidos virtuales, amigos de amigos, etc. Una buena conversación con algunos de ellos bien vale perderse una charla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vamos con mi resumen, aprovechando el feedback que he dejado a cada ponente sobre su charla:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2016.codemotion.es/agenda.html#5732408326356992/90194003&quot;&gt;Los androides no sueñan con ovejas eléctricas; sueñan con conciliar&lt;/a&gt;, por &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/smorcuende&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Susana Morcuende&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yamila_moreno&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yamila Moreno&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; y &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jorgeas80&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jorge Arévalo&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Charla muy necesaria, Susana explicó perfectamente en qué consiste la conciliación, y Yamila y Jorge relataron cómo persiguen este objetivo en sus respectivas empresas: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kaleidosnet&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kaleidos&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; y &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pronoide&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pronoide&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Destaco como ellos que &lt;i&gt;conciliar&lt;/i&gt; no es exclusivo de familias con hijos, todos deberíamos estar preocupados en mantener un correcto balance entre la vida laboral y la personal.&lt;/li&gt;

Interesantísimo. Se notó que Alex domina el asunto y que además se preparó muy bien la charla (las dos cosas no siempre se ven juntas). Además de las valiosas (pero más habituales) comparaciones, transmitió su opinión basada en experiencias reales.&lt;/li&gt;

La charla estuvo bien, pero por el título y la descripción esperaba más.&lt;/li&gt;

El conocimiento del ponente sobre Machine Learning es indudable, pero quiso meter mucho contenido en poco tiempo y al final la charla creo que se quedó corta en detalle teórico y cortísima en contenidos prácticos.&lt;/li&gt;

Siendo un tema complejo y (a priori) espeso, la charla fue muy amena y tremendamente clara. Salí con ganas de dedicarle más tiempo en casa, veremos si mantengo el propósito.&lt;/li&gt;

Buena parte de los consejos son aplicables desde que entras en esta profesión.&lt;/li&gt;
