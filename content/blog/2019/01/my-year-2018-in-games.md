Welcome again to this yearly post, where I try to analyze my gaming behavior during the previous year. I have been doing this since 2011 in Spanish, but this time I will do it in English as with the rest of my posts. You can read about my previous years (in Spanish):

## Analysis

* In this yearly post I used to include a graph with the games played by month, but it turned more or less complex and meaningless as the trend was clear year by year. I tend to play more or less the same along the year with some peaks in the gaming conventions.
* In 2018 I went back to the 2016 numbers in amount of plays, with a higher amount of different games played.
* I've played 61 different games this year, 41 of them were totally new (to me). A very high proportion.
* I recorded 43 gaming sessions, almost 4 per month.
* Again, in 2018 I have **zero** hours recorded in the Steam platform. I miss it and I will give it some priority in 2019.
* My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index"><b><i>h-index</i></b></a> as a player is still at <b>11</b>. Reading carefully the data, I expect to go up at least one level in the next period, as I have several games near the h-index frontier.

## Retrospective

* I still enjoy a lot playing boardgames, role playing games and video games so I will keep this as one of my main leisure activities for 2019
* In January 2018 we finished [Pandemic Legacy Season 1](https://rpggeek.com/boardgame/161936/pandemic-legacy-season-1) the campaign we started back in 2016, but after that I haven't played any other legacy game. I still love cooperative games and I would not reject starting one with a stable playing group, maybe the recently announced [**Journeys in the Middle Earth**](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2019/1/11/the-lord-of-the-rings-journeys-in-middle-earth/)?
* I am becoming addicted to **escape room inspired board games**. In 2018 I have played several [Unlock!](https://rpggeek.com/boardgamefamily/39442/unlock) and [Exit](https://rpggeek.com/boardgamefamily/36963/exit-das-spiel) and for 2019 my goal is to play all the published games of those two families
* I managed (with my party and DM) to maintain since March a monthly [**Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition**](https://rpggeek.com/rpg/17181/dungeons-dragons-5th-edition) campaign, and I only missed one session because of a trip. That is very good news for me and for the entire group, we are [enjoying it a lot](http://ghilbrae.com/tag/storm-kings-thunder/) so we will hopefully continue with the same frequency and passion.
* I'm still eager to play prototypes, but since early 2018 I am no longer a member of [**Asociaci√≥n Ludo**](http://www.asociacionludo.com/). I was not involved at all so, although I miss some of my colleagues there, I decided to leave after realizing that the association does not benefit from me if I'm only providing economic support. I will consider returning when I'm capable of offering more :-(
