Some days ago I had the pleasure to make again an awesome road trip with my friend **Agatha**, this time through the German [**Romantische Strasse**](https://www.romantischestrasse.de/). It is not the first (and most probably will not be the last) trip together, you can read about my trips with her through [Scotland](/blog/2018/05/scotland-a-brief-opinionated-guide/), [Austria](/blog/2017/05/romantikstrasse-the-romantic-road_1/), [Brittany](/blog/2017/12/brittany-a-brief-opinionated-guide/) or [Normandy](/blog/2017/12/normandy-a-brief-opinionated-guide/) (and we have made several more).

I'm adding the _German_ adjective to the title because last year I also traveled with her through the [Austrian Romantikstrasse](/blog/2017/05/romantikstrasse-the-romantic-road_1/). We discovered after that trip that a _similar_ one existed in Germany, so it was about time to travel the german one at least to compare. For your information, there are similar routes in [Japan](https://www.romantischestrasse.de/footer-navigationen/commercial/international/japans-romantic-road/?L=1), [Korea](https://www.romantischestrasse.de/footer-navigationen/commercial/international/romantic-road-of-korea/?L=1) and [Brazil](https://www.romantischestrasse.de/footer-navigationen/commercial/international/romantic-road-in-brazil/?L=1). I neither confirm nor deny that now I want to follow those as well (damn _completism_).

I really needed some holidays to disconnect (this year is being difficult and complex in several ways) and I love to travel in December through central Europe to feel their passion for the X-Mas season and the **mulled wine**. Sadly we couldn't plan a lot in advance (again) but we could at least prepare a draft planning of the places we wanted to visit in those eleven days. We planned (and booked) a couple of days for Dachau and Nuremberg at the beginning of the trip and some days in Munich at the end, 2-4 days depending on the days required for our main priority: The **Romantische Strasse**.

In **11 days** we drove **1.035 kilometers**, we visited **20 towns/cities** and we found [30 caches](https://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=b78f2e04-cd1c-4199-820c-7ea3bb7fea20)!!

Let me summarize our experience in the main stops of the trip. Let's start!

## Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial Site

After having visited [**Auschwitz**](http://auschwitz.org/en/) and [**Mauthausen**](https://www.mauthausen-memorial.org/en) more or less recently, I was not as impressed as others can be with [**Dachau**](http://www.kz-gedenkstaette-dachau.de/index-e.html) but that is only my bias, because Dachau Memorial clearly is worth of a visit.

The _preserved_ part of the original camp is minimum, so the special attractive of Dachau for me was the permanent exhibition located in the former maintenance building, the biggest standing building from the original camp. The explanation about what Dachau was, how it worked and its role in the overall strategy of the Nazis is quite detailed and interesting. They were so proud of the (awful) results that they exported it to other concentration camps as de _Dachau model_.

At the end of the original concentration camp there are several religious temples of different religious faiths. Some of them were closed but in the end they mainly aim at religious people from that specific faith. Nothing to do with the spectacular memorials in Mauthausen.

## Nuremberg

We spent almost 1,5 days in [Nuremberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg), a wonderful place that exceeded my expectations (and they were high). Everything was invaded by tourists because of the seasonal stuff so we happily joined the flock and we walked calmly all the X-Mas stalls, with special attention to the Glühwein ones. We walked a lot through the city center and I loved almost everything that we saw: the Henkersteg (Hangman's Bridge), the Maxbrücke, the Ehekarussell, the Handwerkerhof (Craftmen's Courtyard) and lots of other beautiful streets and buildings. The only locations that we visited properly were the Imperial Castle and the Toy Museum.

The [**Toy Museum**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Toy_Museum) would be interesting just for the fact of having an entire building packed full with toys (some of them new but mostly vintage). Children will enjoy it but also adults of all ages, going through several cabinets of what could have been their toys. One section was entitled for the evolution of the toy concept, where they emphasized the current phenomenon with children _flooded_ by short-lived play stuff, often endangering their creative playing skills. An interesting thought that I mostly share.

The [**Imperial Castle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle) is probably the main attraction in Nuremberg. As almost everything else it was vastly destroyed in the II World War but they successfully rebuilt the entire complex as it was before the war. The exhibition is quite interesting, combining clear explanations of the elements of the Castle in their historical context with information about the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation and the role of the city in that late Middle Ages. I still raise my eyebrows remembering the visit to the _Tiefer Brunnen_ (The Deep Well), you  should not miss it.

I loved to see Nuremberg in X-Mas but I will try to visit again in another season as there is a lot more to see.

## Würzburg

In [Würzburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%BCrzburg) we repeated the tactic. We arrived in the evening to see the city after dawn, and in the next morning we visited the main attraction: the [**Würzburg Residence**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%BCrzburg_Residence), a clear masterwork of German Baroque.

Here we found again some of the places closed (some of them closed for the entire winter) but in overall the town looked fantastic and also worth for another visit at least to see the Gardens and the [Marienberg Fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marienberg_Fortress).

## Tauberbischofsheim

After leaving Würzburg we made a quick stop in [Tauberbischofsheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tauberbischofsheim). We could just visit the Saint Martin church as the rest was closed for the winter, but the visit was worthy anyway. The medieval old town is fantastic and very well preserved, including an interesting Neo-Gothic town hall. We left after a quiet meal watching an intense rain fall through the windows.

## Bad Mergentheim

We left [Bad Mergentheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Mergentheim) after one evening and part of the next morning without been able to visit the [Castle of the Teutonic Order](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schloss_Mergentheim) and the [Teutonic Order Museum](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutschordensmuseum) but in overall it was again a nice visit because the old town was splendid, specially with the seasonal lights and stalls. The heavy rain continued so we had little more to do.

## Weikersheim

Weikersheim was one of the biggest surprises of the trip. The old town was also cute, but I want to highlight the [Weikersheim Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weikersheim_Castle), a fabulous Renaissance palace with Baroque gardens.

The 40 meters long Knights' Hall at the Palace is the most astounding thing that I have seen in ages. It is dedicated to hunting and secret worlds, and any visitor will be amazed by dozens of life-size three-dimensional figures of wildlife animals made in painted stucco, mostly of those that could be hunted in the surroundings but also including exotic pieces like an elephant. The wooden ceiling is also entirely covered with pictures of hunting scenes mixed with local legends. Incredible.

We enjoyed a lot the Castle, if any of the other places that we found closed are similar the Romantische Strasse will crearly worth a second visit.
