I am a **Computer Engineering** graduate, with strong experience guiding and coordinating high performance teams in strategic projects. My skills (emphasizing leadership, mentoring, organization and analysis) have led me to perform all kinds of tasks in addition to the purely technical.

I first learned how to code in the 1990s (developing simple games in _BASIC_) but it was around 2008 when I started living on it first as a software engineer but very soon also as technical leader, team manager or software architect (usually with more than one role at the same time). **ING** crossed my path in 2010 and since then I have been involved in different critical projects where I have performed key roles in the Architecture department as **Enterprise Architect** and **Information Architecture Expert Lead** but also other roles more related to tech delivery such as **IT Area Lead** or **IT Lead (Technology Director)** for the entire COO Domain.

Having a strong interest and experience with Open Source, I am an active participant in several worldwide associations and communities. I still love to learn and also love to teach, so I not only attend but also give as many talks and trainings as I can to contribute back to the community.

My great passion is traveling, so on this website you can find my [_curriculum vitae_ as a traveler](/travel-cv) and [many posts with chronicles about my most notable trips](/tags/tourism). I write them mainly for myself, but I hope they can be useful for any visitor.

I'm an active fellow of several national and international associations: [**ARP-SAPC**](https://www.escepticos.es/) (promoting critical thinking), [**STE**](http://sociedadtolkien.org/) (Sociedad Tolkien Espa침ola) and the [**Tolkien Society**](https://www.tolkiensociety.org/).

I'm also Member of [**Free Software Foundation Europe**](https://fsfe.org/), [**OpenStreetMap Foundation**](https://osmfoundation.org/), [**Spanish Red Cross**](https://www.cruzroja.es/), [**Doctors Without Borders**](https://www.msf.es/), [**Amnesty International**](https://www.amnesty.org/es/) and [**UNHCR**](http://www.acnur.org/), to name a few.

I love hiking, cycling (cycle tourism specially) and traditional archery to the point that I'm federated in [**FMM** (Federaci칩n Madrile침a de Monta침ismo)](https://www.fmm.es/) and [**RFETA** (Spanish Federation of Archery)](https://www.federarco.es/) and I've co-founded with other friends our own traditional archery club: [the **Archers of Ithilien**](http://ithilien.es/).
