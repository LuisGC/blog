I was eager to introduce this section on this site for a long time, after seeing it on my favorite travel blog: [**Dendarii.es**](https://dendarii.es/), written by my dearest **Yami**. Yes, it's about travels since I enjoy more and more traveling and reviewing my trips.

My [**Curriculum Vitae as a traveler**](/travel-cv/) contains two main parts:

* A [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) **map** with all my visited countries with a link to the review that I could have written here in the blog.
* A **chronological list** of all the trips that I have made (as far as I remember)

Looks like I've visited 18 out of 193 countries (among those [recognized by United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_United_Nations)), almost all of them in Europe. Looks like the time has come to expand the range of my trips.

Copying [the model in dendarii.es](https://dendarii.es/cv-viajero/) to this blog took about 10 minutes. Updating it with my trips took a few hours (researching in calendars, several digital photo albums and even Google Maps Timeline) but the greatest effort (at least in time) has been the aesthetic redesign. I could have left the styles as they were but I'm happy with the result.

I hope you like it, you will always find a link to it in the header.
