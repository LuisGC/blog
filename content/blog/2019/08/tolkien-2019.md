{{< image classes="image lateral" src="/img/tolkien-2019-badge.jpg" title="Showing off my double nationality" >}}

If you are reading this you probably know already that I am a big fan of [**J.R.R. Tolkien**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien), to the point that I joined the Spanish Tolkien Society ([**Sociedad Tolkien Española**](http://www.sociedadtolkien.org/)) almost 20 years ago and I usually don't miss any of their events.

Since recently I also belong to the [**Tolkien Society**](https://www.tolkiensociety.org/), and after having missed for probably important (but now unknown) reasons [Tolkien 2005 and Tolkien 2012](https://www.tolkiensociety.org/society/events/conferences/), the last major events that they organized, I was not going to miss [**Tolkien 2019**](https://www.tolkien2019.com/). In 2005 the gathering marked the 50th anniversary of the complete publication of The Lord of The Rings. In 2012 the conference was held to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the publication of The Hobbit. This year the **Tolkien Society** celebrated its own 50th anniversary with the largest celebration of Tolkien ever held. More than **550 attendees** and more than **150 activities** including talks, panels, workshops, signing sessions, music, theater,...

I don't have time right now for a complete review of the event, but I don't want to miss the opportunity to write here some quick impressions of my experience there.

Let me summarize some of the talks and activities I attended:

# Talks

**Heirs of Tolkien? The Major Contenders**, by **Tom Shippey**

The opening keynote was delivered perfectly by Tom Shippey, it was the ideal kickoff for an event like this combining interesting facts and humor. I admire him since long time ago, but even more after having met him in person during the last [XXIV Mereth Aderthad](https://estelcon2019.sociedadtolkien.org/en/). Reading Beowulf together while drinking beer unites a lot, who could have imagined it.

Shippey, with his usual simple slides, started with the slogan of the [Deustche Tolkien Gesellschaft](https://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/): _Ohne Tolkien, keine fantasy_ (without Tolkien, no fantasy) stressing how this _motto_ is still correct nowadays. Tolkien was the first author to achieve mass market success with ambitious and top level quality high fantasy, something that was even more difficult in the previous century. Mass market success in fantasy works is more common nowadays, and this is only because of Tolkien's legacy.

He commented that he is working in a taxonomy of fantasy authors, and also explained who could be a worthy successor of Tolkien. In his opinion only three authors are candidates in quality with their own genuine style: [George RR Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._R._Martin), [Stephen Donaldson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_R._Donaldson) and [Michael Swanwick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Swanwick), all of them heavily influenced by Tolkien. This part was related to the talk he gave in May in Spain comparing the characters, works and values from Tolkien and Martin.

**To the origins of fairy-tales**, by **Enrico Spadaro** ([@EnricoSpadaro7](https://twitter.com/EnricoSpadaro7))

Enrico reminded us the relationship of Tolkien with fairy-tales, and explained the folklore tales that the Professor received as input for inspiration, being the most acknowledged of them the [Kalevala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalevala). The speaker then explained that the [Brothers Grimm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_Grimm) or [Charles Perrault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Perrault) were not the first ones to write fairy-tales in Europe, as there was an Italian author [Giambattista Basile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giambattista_Basile) that was the first one (that we know) to include fairy-tales tales in [Lo Cunto de Li Cunte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentamerone). His tales included the first appearance of Cinderella, Rapunzel or the Sleeping Beauty.

**On the nature and corporeality of Elves and Fairies according to Tolkien**, by **Massimiliano Izzo**

Very interesting and well documented talk, about how Tolkien speculated on the real nature of elves and how this vision evolved through his life. Metaphysical and sometimes even philosophical discussions that will deserve a quiet read when the proceedings are published.

**Four Brethren Heroes of the Gondolindrim - Egalmoth, Ecthelion, Glorfindel and Legolas : A mythic and linguistic exploration**, by **Andrew Higgins** ([@asthiggins](https://twitter.com/asthiggins))

Andrew Higgins explained very briefly how these four important characters are related to heroes from the Classical and Medieval works Tolkien could have known. He commented how Tolkien could have thought the names for each of them, linking as usual the meaning with the character. Again, it will be nice to read the final paper in the proceedings.

**Two Realms: Finished and Unfinished Business**, by **Ted Nasmith**

This was the first of many talks focusing on the illustration of Tolkien's works. This time, Ted Nasmith himself showed us some of his recent commissioned works related to Middle-earth and at the end also to The Song of Ice and Fire. It's impossible to articulate in words what he showed us: lots of illustrations including preliminary drafts or color tests that I would happily put in my walls.

Ted is not only a gifted artist but also proved to be friendly to his fans and methodical in his work.

**Leaf by Niggle**, by **Puppet State Theatre** ([@PuppetStateThtr](https://twitter.com/PuppetStateThtr))

Richard Medringtone from the _Puppet State Theatre_ showed us how one single person on stage can grab the attention of the audience for more than an hour. He is clearly a top professional in acting, and the adaptation of Leaf by Niggle fitted his acting perfectly. The stage setting, despite being minimalistic, was adequate and the protagonist made good use of almost all its elements. I loved the play and will see it again without hesitation.

**Clothing in Tolkien’s world and what we can see through its historical analysis**, by **Dr. Ester Torredelforth** ([@Torredelforth](https://twitter.com/torredelforth))

Ester, Doctor in medieval art and fashion, made a brilliant exposition of the facts that can be understood or extracted from the way Tolkien describes clothing details. Se used several designs prepared by herself to support her lecture, describing how Tolkien must have known with a decent level about medieval fashion and its utility and symbolism.

**Aratalindalë - The Making of a Myth**, by **Maggie Percival**

I was not sure about this talk, but I'm glad I finally attended it. The purpose of the lecture was to describe the process she and some other colleagues followed to prepare the Masquerade for the London WorldCon of 2014 where [they won several prizes including Best overall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/72nd_World_Science_Fiction_Convention). They prepared a group costume entitled Aratalindalë that included eight Valar as they are described in The Silmarillion.

Maggie explained with lots of details the reasoning after all the designs including the selection of fabrics and how they combined traditional dressmaking skills with modern technology using LED lights in the costumes with certain level of animation designed for each Vala. There are [several pictures online](https://www.tolkiensociety.org/2014/08/tolkien-society-members-triumph-at-worldcon-masquerade/) but I haven't found the full video where all the lighting features can be seen properly.

**Tolkien and Italy**, by **Oronzo Cilli** ([@Tolkieniano](https://twitter.com/Tolkieniano))

Oronzo described his research about the relationship between Tolkien and Italy. He traveled there at least a couple of times and apparently there are several details that show he enjoyed and was influenced by the Italian culture. For example, it is known that Tolkien joined the Oxford Dante Society.

**Tolkien's Library**, by **Oronzo Cilli** ([@Tolkieniano](https://twitter.com/Tolkieniano)) with **Tom Shippey**

One of the editorial releases of the year related to Tolkien studies and scholarship. The book is _just_ a list of what could have been part of the Professor's own library, and for each item Oronzo describes if the entry comes from a primary source, a secondary source, etc. Quite interesting if you are curious about the type of works Tolkien owned or had read. As new evidence appears, the list will have to be expanded with new entries.

The room was full also because Tom Shippey wrote the foreword and also participated in the lecture.

**France 1913. Tolkien's first job**, by **Jose Manuel Ferrández Bru** ([@JosManuelFerrn1](https://twitter.com/JosManuelFerrn1))

My colleague from the ([**STE**](http://www.sociedadtolkien.org/)) is becoming a regular for these types of events, and no wonder it's like that with the quality and amount of research he has been doing over the last years. This time the lecture was about how a very young Tolkien got a job as tutor of a bunch of kids during a trip to France. Without spoiling the details, let's say that the task was suddenly complicated and could have disrupted Tolkien in a unique way.

**The Two Towers of Birmingham, and other follies**, by **John Garth** ([@JohnGarthWriter](https://twitter.com/JohnGarthWriter))

It was believed that a couple of towers from Birmingham (Perrott's Folly and the Edgbaston Waterworks tower) may have provided the inspiration for the Two Towers in the Lord of the Rings. John Garth started his keynote explaining why he does not consider this argument very solid. First of all, which two towers? Minas Morgul and Minas Tirith? Orthanc and Barad-dûr? It's still ambiguous. Garth reviewed all the early designs that we have from Tolkien about those towers, analyzing the evolution of them.

The lecture also served somehow as a teaser for his next book, called for the moment as _Tolkien's Worlds_.

**LOTR on Prime** panel, by **Shaun Gunner** ([@ShaunGunner](https://twitter.com/ShaunGunner)) with **Brian Sibley**, **Dimitra Fimi** ([@Dr_Dimitra_Fimi](https://twitter.com/Dr_Dimitra_Fimi)), **Anke Eißmann** ([@khorazir](https://twitter.com/khorazir)), **Jeremy Edmonds** ([@TolkienGuide](https://twitter.com/TolkienGuide)) and **Marcel Aubron-Bülles** ([@The_Tolkienist](https://twitter.com/The_Tolkienist))

This panel was promising, first of all because the selection of participants was very well balanced with writers, scholars and artists offering different perspectives about their expectations. Of course they did not give any factual data, and probably that is the reason they were there in the panel giving their opinions freely and not Tom Shippey that is directly involved in the project.

I specially liked the contributions by Brian Sibley, who was fully engaged in all the Peter Jackson films, and Anke Eißmann, who is eager like me to see in the new series a more daring production compared specially to The Hobbit films. Let's hope they don't try to imitate the style of Game of Thrones.

**Alan Lee's Sketchbook**, by **Alan Lee** ([@AlanLee11225760](https://twitter.com/AlanLee11225760))

Despite the main room was completely full, the organization switched off the lights for the audience and everyone was in absolute silence listening to the careful explanations by Alan Lee. It was almost magical and completely amazing. We could see dozens of sketches explained from the genius himself, from watercolor exercises to architectural blueprints. Lee's view on Middle-earth is engraved in the mind of many people (including mine) and we were very lucky that his vision was also omnipresent in Peter Jackson's films.

There was also time for him to answer a lot of questions from the audience, some of them related to their relationship with other artists like John Howe.

**Orchestra Concert**, by **The People's Orchestra** ([@ThePeoplesOrch](https://twitter.com/ThePeoplesOrch))

After enjoying a couple of beers in a nearby pub we came back for the concert, we were very lucky and we were able to take seats in the front row just behind the Orchestra director. We were entertained not only with the soundtracks of all the LotR and The Hobbit movies, but also with several other compositions from our vast geek popular culture. Both the orchestra and its conductor demonstrated an impressive quality and charisma, one could see the effort to please the audience.

The [People's Orchestra](https://thepeoplesorchestra.com/) is a charity apart from a standard symphony orchestra. They provide professional musical training and even work opportunities for unemployed people. Impressive.

**Grendel's Mother and Tolkien's Women**, by **Jane Chance** ([@janegalv](https://twitter.com/janegalv))

The speaker was humorous and kind with the audience, taking into account she delivered the talk without any kind of visual support very early on Friday morning. As the recognized expert in the field that she is, Jane spoke clearly and concisely about the role of Grendel's Mother in Beowulf. After that, she managed to link the topic with the attitude of Tolkien about women in his professional academical experience. The talk was interesting but I could not connect some dots on the spot, hopefully I will with the proceedings.

**Pauline Diana Baynes - An artists inspiration**, by **Jay Johnstone** ([@jaystolkien](https://twitter.com/jaystolkien))

After having met Jay in the Dealer's room and having enjoyed his own amazing pieces of art, I was curious about this talk. I expected him to explain not only his admiration for the artist but also his opinion as a passionate collector. I received what I expected, by far.

Pauline was a prolific and very special artist. She illustrated or contributed to more than 200 books, gaining international fame as the first illustrator and cover artist of some Tolkien _minor_ works (Farmer Giles of Ham, The Adventures of Tom Bombadil, Smith of Wootton Major, ...) and [Chronicles of Narnia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicles_of_Narnia) by [C.S. Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis). As an example of masterpiece, the speaker showed us [the illustration she did for a Nursery Rhymes book](https://www.agefotostock.com/age/en/Stock-Images/Rights-Managed/MEV-10435133), in which she featured 56 different characters from the collected tales in one single page.

I learned in the talk that Pauline illustrated Farmer Giles of Ham by pure chance, according to Jay Tolkien was visiting his editors to complain about the artwork proposal he had received and luckily a sketchbook by Pauline was open over a table.

Jay showed us some less known drawings and we were amazed both with the artwork and Jay's explanations during the entire hour. He clearly infected me with his passion, I entered the room knowing Pauline Baynes only a little and left as a new declared fan.

**Artists in Middle-earth: illustrating The Lord of the Rings**, by **Marie Bretagnolle** ([@MarieBreta](https://twitter.com/MarieBreta))

The abstract of the talk announced that [Marie Bretagnolle](https://voirtolkien.hypotheses.org/) was going to compare two of the most important British editions of The Lord of the Rings, also the only ones with commissioned illustrations inside. First the 1977 [Folio Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folio_Society) edition, and the second by Alan Lee for the 1991-1992 Centenary edition.

Marie delivered a clear and interesting talk, comparing the illustrations in both works and analyzing the importance of each drawing depending on the location. For example, the artist needs to take into account that an illustration that appears before the passage that is portrayed can provide inspiration for some readers but it can also work as a small spoiler for others.

Maria is also to blame that I just spent a small fortune in the [Folio Society](https://www.foliosociety.com/) website.

**The source texts for Tove Jansson's illustrations for The Hobbit**, by **Sonja Virta** ([@SonjaVirta](https://twitter.com/SonjaVirta))

**The Shape of Water in Tolkien's Middle-earth**, by **Norbert Schürer**

**Bilbo, Ulysses and the Greatness of the Unknown**, by **Gloria Larini**

**Memory, Lore, Knowledge**, by **Thomas Honegger**

Another quite interesting talk. The speaker explained the concepts, remarking the difference that Tolkien made among them. For example, regarding memory we can find _live_ memory (Gandalf, Galadriel, ...) and dormant memory (the ring verse, old Gondor lore). The main part of the talk was about the difference (almost opposition) between knowledge and lore. In Middle-earth, knowledge is perceived as negative (Saruman is the main representative) but Lore is usually positive (Ioreth, as the best example). Lore cannot be learned, it needs to be handed over or it will be lost. That is why knowledge can increase, but Lore can only decline.
