Last week it was very special, as I had the opportunity and the privilege to deliver [three different talks, in three consecutive days, in two international events](https://twitter.com/luiyo/status/1194750663428837381): **Big Things Conference 2019** and **Commit Conf 2019**. This crazy coincidence forces me to write one single post to summarize my experience in both events, starting with an overview of my three talks.

**TLDR;**

Taking advantage of this, I've created a new section on this website to publish the [main public talks](/talks) I'm proudly giving. For each talk you will find some basic data, a link to the slides, and also a link to the video for those talks that are recorded and published.

Let me summarize some of the talks I attended:

# Big Things Conference 2019

[**Big Things Conference 2019**](https://www.bigthingsconference.com/2019/), previously called **Big Data Spain**, is one of the most relevant conferences about Big Data and Artificial Intelligence across Europe. This was the 7th edition and the first one with the new name and branding but they continued with the format of the past events with an interesting balance between technology, business propositions and innovative ideas. According to the organizers this year they had more than 2,000 attendees and 92 talks in just two days.

# Commit Conf 2019

[**Commit Conf 2019**](https://2019.commit-conf.com/) is also one of the biggest conferences in Spain related to software development. The contents are more generic and the public is completely different, as the target audience is developers or students. The numbers for 2019 were impressive: 9 tracks in parallel (+ 3 workshop tracks), more than 2,000 attendees and 140 talks/workshops.
