Some days ago I had the pleasure to make an awesome road trip through Scotland with my friend **Agatha**, my travel companion lately. It was my second time in Scotland, after a great trip a couple of years ago to visit mainly Edinburgh. So, this time the Scottish capital was discarded as a destination and the goal was to visit as much as possible of the rest of this beautiful country.

In six days we drove around **a thousand miles** and hiked almost **40 kilometers**, without taking into account the walks through cities and towns.

# What to expect from this guide

Again (and it's starting to be an issue) we had to prepare the trip in just a few days. Some places were more or less familiar to me and for years I've had a terrible desire to visit the Isle of Skye, but apart from that all the initial research was full of positive surprises.

This is the initial map of Scotland must-visit destinations prepared by Agatha, except the Isle of Skye prepared by myself. Sadly we couldn't visit all of them, because we decided to do as much hiking as possible and we took it very easy in general.
