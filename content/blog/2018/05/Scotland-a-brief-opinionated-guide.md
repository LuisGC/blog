Some weeks ago I had the pleasure to make an awesome road trip through Scotland with my friend **Agatha**, my travel companion lately. It was my second time in Scotland, after a great trip three years ago to visit mainly Edinburgh. So, this time the Scottish capital was discarded as a destination and the goal was to visit as much as possible of the rest of this beautiful country.

In six days we drove around **a thousand miles** and hiked almost **40 kilometers**, without taking into account the countless walks through cities and towns, and we found [more than 25 caches](https://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=b78f2e04-cd1c-4199-820c-7ea3bb7fea20).

# What to expect from this guide

Again (and it's starting to be an issue) we had to prepare the trip in just a few days. Some places were more or less familiar to me and for years I've had a terrible desire to visit the Isle of Skye, but apart from that all the initial research was full of positive surprises.

Let me show you the initial map of Scotland _must visit_ destinations prepared by Agatha, except the Isle of Skye prepared by myself. Sadly we couldn't visit all of those places because we decided to do as much hiking as possible and we took it very easy in general.

Let's start!

## Day 1

We arrived to the Glasgow International Airport very very soon to make the most out of the first day. We lost some of this advantage struggling with the car rental company. In the end the experience with them was OK but it started horribly bad. They gave us a car smaller than expected (and booked, and payed) but at least it had automatic transmission and in the end it was comfortable enough for two and very appropriate and comfortable to drive on normally one lane roads.

Our first destination was [**Balloch**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloch,_West_Dunbartonshire), on the southern shore of the beautiful [**Loch Lomond**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_Lomond), the largest inland stretch of water in Great Britain by surface area. We visited the castle gardens and walked through the main road (including our first beers of the trip, mine without alcohol). Balloch is a popular destination because lots of ferries leave from there to navigate the lake. The only ship that we boarded was _The Maid of the Loch_, a beautiful paddle steamer (the last to be built in Britain) that is coupled to the pier and serves nowadays as a cafeteria. Apparently is being restored by a charity whose aim is to return her into operation again.

The next stop was [**Luss**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luss), a touristic small town a few kilometers up the lake shore. The center of the town was very beautiful, specially the surroundings of the Parish church, but there were too many tourist per square meter. Before leaving we had a nice lunch in [a quaint restaurant](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4431180826), including the best chicken chipotle wrap that I've ever eaten.

Soon in the afternoon we arrived to the starting point of [**Puck's Glen**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puck%27s_Glen), probably the most beautiful walking trail that I've seen. Puck's Glen is amazing, the pictures cannot capture the atmosphere in the whole place. Looks like it's named after the character of [William Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare)'s play [A Midsummer Night's Dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Midsummer_Night%27s_Dream) and it surely resembles a fantastic dream with all the ingredients: huge trees, breathtaking viewpoints, streams, water falls, ravines,... The hike is not very long and it's totally accessible so you should not miss it if you come near the area.

We finished our first stage near [**Oban**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oban), a beautiful resort town around a nice bay. It has a curious monument, [McCraig's Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCaig%27s_Tower) and lots of restaurants and hotels. Despite this, we chose a promising Bed and Breakfast in a town nearby.

**Bonus recommendation**: the [Grove House](https://www.booking.com/hotel/gb/grove-guest-house-oban.html) Bed and Breakfast exceeded all our expectations. They were extremely nice with us (including waiting until late for the check-in), gave us two rooms for the same price so we could sleep more comfortably and an impressive breakfast. I took one my favorite breakfasts in the UK: smoked herring grilled.
