	&lt;p&gt;This is the fourth part of my chronicle about our trip through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.romantikstrasse.at/es/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romantikstraße&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you can read the rest here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/05/Romantikstrasse-the-Romantic-Road_1.html&quot;&gt;Romantikstraße, the Romantic Road (1 of 5)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/06/Romantikstrasse-the-Romantic-Road_2.html&quot;&gt;Romantikstraße, the Romantic Road (2 of 5)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/06/Romantikstrasse-the-Romantic-Road_3.html&quot;&gt;Romantikstraße, the Romantic Road (3 of 5)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Day 4&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our fourth stage started in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lauterbacher.at/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gästehaus Lauterbacher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a splendid guesthouse in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neumarkt_am_Wallersee&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neumarkt am Wallersee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Quite off our route because we couldn&apos;t find anything affordable in Mondsee. We wanted a good place to rest after a hard day 3, and Lauterbacher was more than good. The place itself was nice and the owners were marvellous with us. I&apos;ll seriously consider returning to this place if I ever come back to the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thus it began the most awaited stage of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Postalm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our way to Hallstatt we drived through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postalm.at/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Postalm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a mountain pass which is part of a very well preserved and protected Natural Park. Just to cross the area you need to pay a tax (5€ per adult, 2 per children and so on). Normally you&apos;ll pay to spend the morning, the day or the weekend inside: it&apos;s full of hiking routes, mountain bike tracks and even several ski slopes for the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it was early in the morning, it was almost empty. We only came across a couple of cars and several herds of cows. The scenery was beautiful: everything was green, mist here and there, and almost no sign of mankind except a few piles of stacked wood and the road itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved the place, although we only stopped a couple of times to make pictures. Another place that I hope to return in the future with my hiking equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gosau&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next stop was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosau&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gosau&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We also spent less time than expected here, we were eager to arrive Hallstatt as soon as possible. We crossed the town a couple of times, made some pictures, visited a lake,... great if it was not what we had been doing the past three days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2017/07/Gosau.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gosau&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hallstatt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, we arrived &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallstatt&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hallstatt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the main destination of the entire trip. I generally liked it and of course it&apos;s very beautiful, but I must say that it might be overrated (imho).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that we did was to go up to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.salzwelten.at/en/home/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salz Welten&lt;/em&gt; (Salt World) complex&lt;/a&gt; using a funicular. The views were as amazing as this during the climb:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2017/07/Hallstatt_Salzbergbahn.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Southern part of Hallstatt&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right after ascending you&apos;ll find what they call the &lt;i&gt;World Heritage View&lt;/i&gt; (with the corresponding restaurant and souvenir shop): an impressive viewpoint from which you can see much of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallst%C3%A4tter_See&quot;&gt;Hallstätter See&lt;/a&gt; lake and just below, small (because it is small) the old town of Hallstatt on the lake shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2017/07/Hallstatt_World_Heritage_View.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hallstatt World Heritage View&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image lateral&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2017/07/Hallstatt_Salz_Welten.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hallstatt Salz Welten&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Miners&lt;/i&gt; sheltering from the rain in the Hallstatt Salt Mine &lt;br /&gt;Source: My own pictures - &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;CC BY-NC-SA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They claim that the Hallstatt Salt Mine is the oldest salt mine in Europe, but what they have there is more a tourist trap (as we guessed beforehand) than an historical or practical recreation. Yes, during the visit you go underground and they even give you a miner outfit, but the visit consists almost exclusively of videos and light effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes the visit &lt;em&gt;unique&lt;/em&gt; are wooden slides by which you descend from some galleries to others. It&apos;s curious, but after the second one it&apos;s not that thrilling and with a big group visiting the mines it&apos;s bottleneck after bottleneck. These slides are the reason behind the miner outfit, because apart of them the risk of staining or tearing your clothes is null. A curious thing, being a mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe I&apos;m biased, after visiting in 2016 the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wieliczka_Salt_Mine&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wieliczka Salt Mine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Poland, near Krakow. Wieliczka is a really huge mine, the areas that are visitable are much more impressive and the information is infinite times more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily for you as future visitors, the funicular ticket to visit at least the World Heritage View can be purchased separately from the entrance to the mines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that bittersweet flavor, we went down again to visit the old town, full of restaurants, hotels and souvenir shops. The best approach to visit Hallstatt is to lose yourself in its streets, alleys and stairs. I liked some hidden corners more than the typical streets or squares. In fact, what could be a very cool area for visitors (next to the church) is used as parking and therefore is full of cars. Cars and vans can be seen on any &lt;i&gt;postcard picture&lt;/i&gt;, as this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2017/07/Hallstatt_tourist_picture.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hallstatt typical tourist picture&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Hallstatt from the &lt;i&gt;postcard picture&lt;/i&gt; spot&lt;br /&gt;Source: My own pictures - &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;CC BY-NC-SA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I say &lt;i&gt;postcard picture&lt;/i&gt; because since you enter the town there are signs for you to go to the spot from which the &lt;i&gt;postcard picture&lt;/i&gt; can be made. Looks like the spot it&apos;s important for them, so I added &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4844412062&quot;&gt;the viewpoint to OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took dozens of postcard pictures and postcard selfies, struggling to avoid that other tourists could appear. It was packed full of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very cool thing about Hallstatt is that the cemetery is located between the houses that surround the catholic church. There is so little place to bury people there that every ten years bones used to be exhumed and removed into an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossuary&quot;&gt;ossuary&lt;/a&gt;, to make room for new burials. A collection of elaborately decorated skulls with the deceased&apos;s name, profession and date of death inscribed on them is on display in a small chapel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2017/07/Hallstatt_Beinhaus.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hallstatt Beinhaus&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Hallstatt Beinhaus, where you can show off your skull forever&lt;br /&gt;Source: My own pictures - &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;CC BY-NC-SA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently it&apos;s possible to leave written in your will that you want your skull to end there. Think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Obertraun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended the day (and we could also say our Romantikstraße trip) in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obertraun&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obertraun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, another touristic place just in front of Hallstatt in the lakeshore. Obertraun also has it&apos;s own funicular with caves, mines and breath-taking views, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dachstein-salzkammergut.com/en/dachstein/dachstein/&quot;&gt;Dachstein Salzkammergut&lt;/a&gt;, but as it was raining and very foggy we prefered to stay in the lakeshore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the heavy rain and the mist, we took a couple of glasses of the wine we had bought in Kremsmünster and went for a walk. In the lakeshore there were several floating platforms, ready to receive bathers in the summer. We toured the entire village and we even entered a small forest in the mouth of the Koppentraun river to search for a caché (and it was worth it!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After starting to worry about not find any open restaurant, we discovered the perfect place (and it was beside our hotel): Kegelbahn, a restaurant with typical local food, and a small bowling alley! After a delicious onion soup, a superb goulash and an exquisite cheesecake, we occupied the bowling alley until they closed the place. It was such a fun and unexpected moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our visit on the fifth and last day is not strictly part of the Romantikstraße route, but it&apos;ll be part of my review anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay tuned for the last episode!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;This is the third part of my chronicle about our trip through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.romantikstrasse.at/es/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romantikstraße&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you can read the rest here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/05/Romantikstrasse-the-Romantic-Road_1.html&quot;&gt;Romantikstraße, the Romantic Road (1 of 5)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/06/Romantikstrasse-the-Romantic-Road_2.html&quot;&gt;Romantikstraße, the Romantic Road (2 of 5)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/07/Romantikstrasse-the-Romantic-Road_4.html&quot;&gt;Romantikstraße, the Romantic Road (4 of 5)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Day 3&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two days visiting splendid places with invaluable surprises, we finally decided to discard a short visit to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salzburg&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salzburg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in order to spend more time on each stage of our trip. We wanted to take advantage of our rental car and Salzbug deserves to be visited more calmly (and you don&apos;t need a car to go there). For similar reasons, we also ruled out going to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohenwerfen_Castle&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hohenwerfen Castle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it was the right decision, because it allowed us to make the most of the remaining of our road trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sankt Wolfgang im Salzkammergut&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Wolfgang_im_Salzkammergut&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sankt Wolfgang im Salzkammergut&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most touristic places of Austria. I suspect that I&apos;d have prefered to visit this town 15-20 years ago, now it&apos;s excessively exploited touristically. In the narrow streets of the center I had the feeling of being inside a theme park, and unfortunately one with many more shops than attractions. It is possible that the shops and restaurants themselves are nowadays the attractions. Not for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image lateral&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2017/06/Schafbergbahn.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Schafbergbahn trains crossing&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Schafbergbahn trains crossing&lt;br /&gt;Source: My own pictures - &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;CC BY-NC-SA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still we had a great time there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started the day by climbing on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schafberg_Railway&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schafbergbahn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a rack railway leading in the warmer half of the year from almost the lakeshore of the &lt;em&gt;Wolfgangsee&lt;/em&gt; lake to the summit of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/yc6umwwp&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schafberg&lt;/strong&gt; mountain&lt;/a&gt; (1,783 m). From the viewpoints of Schafberg it is possible to see 9 of the main lakes of Austria, countless mountains and an infinite 360º landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially it reminded me to a small version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungfrau_Railway&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jungfraubahn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which I visited in 2013. Saving the differences because the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungfraujoch&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jungfraujoch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; station is the highest station in Europe (3,454 m), the line is more than twice as long and the amount of visitors is probably exponentially greater in the Jungfrau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, due to some construction works in the railway, the train only reached the &lt;strong&gt;Schafbergalpe&lt;/strong&gt; (1,363 m), an intermediate railway halt with a big guest house, a couple of private houses and traces of many hiking trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite not being on the mountaintop, the views were overwhelming. We wandered around the area, taking lots of pictures but as you can imagine they don&apos;t capture the feeling of being up there surrounded by such a wonderful environment. For my next visit I promise to bring adequate equipment to do some hiking route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2017/06/Schafbergalpe.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Staring into the endless mountains at Schafbergalpe&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Staring into the endless mountains at Schafbergalpe&lt;br /&gt;Source: My own pictures - &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;CC BY-NC-SA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the descent came one of the funniest moments of the trip. As we saw in many other places, on the lakeshore of Sankt Wolfgang there were some boat-rental locations. Instead of renting a paddle boat, we chose an small boat with electric engine to try to make a longer trip through the Wolfgangsee lake. In the end, our boat wasn&apos;t much faster than a paddle boat but at least could entertain ourselves doing the clown on board instead of pedaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note to my wise readers: What translation to English do you suggest for &lt;em&gt;&quot;hacer el pertur&quot;&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2017/06/Wolfgangsee_sailing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sailing on the Wolfgangsee&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from amusing ourselves stupidly, from the boat we could contemplate the town from its best perspective. In the next picture you can perfectly see what I mean, a &lt;em&gt;postcard&lt;/em&gt; view with the main landmarks: the catholic Church of Sainkt Wolfgang and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Horse_Inn&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Im Weißen Rößl&lt;/strong&gt; (The White Horse Inn)&lt;/a&gt;. The inn (now an expensive hotel with a couple of fine restaurants) is very popular for a successful operetta of the same name in which the protagonist is a bartender of the inn desperately in love with the owner of The White Horse. The show has been performed several times mainly across Germany and Austria, but in the 1930s it was even featured on Broadway and the West End of London. There are also several movie and TV series adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2017/06/Sainkt_Wolfgang_postcard_picture.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Postcard picture of Sainkt Wolfgang im Salzkammergut&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Postcard&lt;/i&gt; picture of Sainkt Wolfgang im Salzkammergut, with the Church of Sainkt Wolfgang and the &lt;b&gt;Im Weißen Rößl&lt;/b&gt; (the yellow building)&lt;br /&gt;Source: My own pictures - &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;CC BY-NC-SA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tried to escape from the tourist traps as much as we could, but in Sainkt Wolfgang it was a really difficult task to achieve. Finally we had lunch in &lt;a href=&quot;http://hubertuskeller.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hubertuskeller&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It was very good and not absurdly expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bad Ischl&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the afternoon we improvised a visit to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Ischl&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad Ischl&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it was our main mistake of the trip, but it was our fault and not because the city is not interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The center of Bad Ischl is very beautyful and it&apos;s very well maintained, but the main attraction is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiservilla&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kaiservilla&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, summer residence of the Austrian Imperial family, and we couldn&apos;t see it because it was closed. The town is also famous for it&apos;s salt mines and offers several health spas, but we didn&apos;t have time to enjoy them. We walked throught the center, we searched for a couple of cachés and we left to reach Mondsee before sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2017/06/Bad_Ischl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Post Office and the Trinkhalle in Bad Ischl&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mondsee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/y93dqhp2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mondsee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is famous for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondsee_Abbey&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mondsee Abbey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Basilica of Saint Michael&lt;/em&gt;, inside which it was filmed the wedding scene of the film &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/y9dphtp9&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sound of Music&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We did not arrive in time to visit the church but at least we managed to quietly stroll around the village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a recommendation we tasted a local variety of wine and an assortment of local cheeses, and they were good but nothing special. We enjoyed particularly the Strandpromenade, from which we could see the sunset falling on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/yd5c2h4a&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mondsee&lt;/em&gt; lake&lt;/a&gt;. I&apos;ve just discovered in Wikipedia that Mondsee is one of Austria&apos;s last privately owned lakes. In August 2008, the owner announced it was up for sale. WTF! &lt;strong&gt;Fucking Private Property!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for some detail, Mondsee is similar to other towns we had already visited in our trip, but surely it is worth spending more time here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were not able to find a reasonably priced accommodation here so we booked something about 20 km away and off our route, and surprisingly there we met the most incredible host in the world. But this story belongs to our next day...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay tuned for next episodes!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;This is the second part of my chronicle about our trip through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.romantikstrasse.at/es/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romantikstraße&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you can read the rest here:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/07/Romantikstrasse-the-Romantic-Road_4.html&quot;&gt;Romantikstraße, the Romantic Road (4 of 5)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Day 2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kremsmünster&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stift-kremsmuenster.net/tourismus/information-in-english/english/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kremsmünster Abbey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was the most positive surprise of the entire trip. A priori it looked like &lt;em&gt;yet another&lt;/em&gt; abbey, and our first hour there not only was confirming that suspicion but also made us feel somewhat deceived. We paid a considerable amount of money to find out that the ticket didn&apos;t include the visit of what we particularly wanted to see in there: The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tassilo_Chalice&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tassilo Chalice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kremsm%C3%BCnster_Abbey#Library&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Library&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.specula.at/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mathematical Tower&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We could only access the public areas and the inner gardens where they temporaly hosted a floral exhibition. The information was confusing, mostly in german only, and the variety of ticket options was the most complex that I&apos;ve ever seen in a place like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image lateral&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2017/06/Kremsmunster_Mathematical_Tower.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kremsmünster Mathematical Tower&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Kremsmünster Mathematical Tower&lt;br /&gt;Source: My own pictures - &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;CC BY-NC-SA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After visiting the gardens and the Abbey Church we followed some unclear signs to the Tassilo, and when we were almost there a couple of exhibition guides insisted us that our tickets didn&apos;t include this area, so they charged us again (without any kind of ticket) to enter the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kremsm%C3%BCnster_Abbey#Treasures&quot;&gt;Treasure Chamber&lt;/a&gt; and a couple more rooms with minor interest. The Tassilo is an interesting piece of art and history, but the extra price to see it seemed disproportionate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were about to leave, almost angry, but in the end we bought another additional ticket to visit the &lt;em&gt;panorama terrace&lt;/em&gt; on top of the Mathematical Tower even though it only included climbing up the stairs and going out on the terrace to see the views from there. The rest of the building was not included in our handful of tickets but at least we&apos;d see some of what we initially wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there, waiting at the entrance of the tower, our luck changed with the stellar appearance of &lt;strong&gt;Anna&lt;/strong&gt;. I&apos;ll call her Anna as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_popular_given_names#Female_names_4&quot;&gt;most popular female name in Austria&lt;/a&gt; to preserve her identity, not because I don&apos;t remember her real name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incredible kindness of Anna, her desire to practice spoken English and the fact that there were no more tourists in the visit, made our day radically better. Waiting to see if anyone else was joining the visit we told her about our bad luck and poor understanding of the information for tourists, and she emphatized and wanted to compensate us in some way. She couldn&apos;t realize that we&apos;d bought like three different tickets to leave without seeing what we expected to see (the main attractions, by the way).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image lateral&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2017/06/Xylothek-Sternwarte_Kremsmunster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Xylotheque - Sternwarte Kremsmünster&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Xylotheque - Sternwarte Kremsmünster&lt;br /&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Xylothek-Sternwarte_Kremsm%C3%BCnster.JPG&quot;&gt;Reinhard Stiksel in Wikimedia&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We climbed the Tower, but instead of going directly to the top we stopped at each floor and briefly visited the exhibition rooms. One room was a small Natural History collection with several stuffed animals, minerals, all kind of insects, other contained an interesting collection of vintage astronomical devices and globes, another presented diverse regional folklore, ethnology and popular costumes,... We didn&apos;t make any picture acknowledging that the visit was unofficial, but I can still remember an amazing cabinet with a curious &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylotheque&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xylotheque&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, pieces of different types of wood carved as books that contained their characteristic leaf, fruit or flower. I&apos;d found a picture in Wikimedia, take a look right here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anna&apos;s infinite friendliness did not end there. On our way down she offered to negotiate for us a private visit to the Library, guided by herself. She managed to convince her boss, and paying an additional ticket at a reduced price we got to see the rest of the art collections and the impressive Library. We visited the Imperial Hall, several rooms with a nice art collection (mainly paintings) and finally the Library. We could&apos;ve spent hours there...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2017/06/Kremsmunster_Library.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kremsmünster Library&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;d planned to be in Kremsmünster just a couple of hours , but finally we were there all morning so we had to lunch just there, in a traditional restaurant inside the Abbey grounds: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stiftsschank-kremsmuenster.or.at/&quot;&gt;Stiftsschank&lt;/a&gt;. It was great so we recommend it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scharnstein&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scharnstein&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scharnstein&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stands out for its variety of hiking trails, since it&apos;s surrounded by forests and mountains. It&apos;s also near &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totes_Gebirge&quot;&gt;Totes Gebirge&lt;/a&gt;, a picturesque mountain range part of the Limestone Alps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our extended visit to the Kremsmünster Abbey forced us to expend less time here, but at least we could do some light hiking. We made one of the typical routes: climbing from the town to the &lt;strong&gt;ruins of the Scharnstein Castle&lt;/strong&gt;. Both the ascent and the exploration of the ruins were fantastic. We were lucky enough to be completely alone, so it was a relaxing experience and a total immersion in the Nature that surrounded us. The views were excellent, with the remains of the castle with the huge Almtal valley behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2017/06/Scharnstein_Castle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Relaxing at Scharnstein Castle&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Scharnstein you can also find an interesting &lt;a href=&quot;http://kriminalmuseum.at/krimscharn.html&quot;&gt;Criminological Museum&lt;/a&gt;. We went there but it was closed, so we settled for a beer in a tavern located in the same Scharnstein Castle that hosts the Museum about Crime and another about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/ybusmk79&quot;&gt;Austrian Federal Gendarmerie&lt;/a&gt;. The tavern was promising but they&apos;ll have to admit that it has seen better days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Traunkirchen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next stop was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traunkirchen&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traunkirchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a small village known for its idyllic location on a small peninsula overlooking the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traunsee&quot;&gt;Traunsee Lake&lt;/a&gt;. It&apos;s probably the place where we took more pictures per minute, and that&apos;s considering that the best pictures of the village are made from the lake itself. It was a short walk, but it was totally worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our way there we booked with our mobile a guest house in other village. If we had seen the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dastraunsee.at/en/&quot;&gt;Das Traunsee Seehotel&lt;/a&gt; before... we&apos;d have spent the night there regardless of how much we were charged, and it didn&apos;t seem cheap. The views and the back terrace of the hotel were incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gmunden&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We planned to end our second stage in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmunden&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gmunden&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the most important town of the region and where the &lt;em&gt;Traun River&lt;/em&gt; empties into the &lt;em&gt;Traunsee Lake&lt;/em&gt;, at the foot of the &lt;em&gt;Traunstein mountain&lt;/em&gt; and near the beautiful village of &lt;em&gt;Traunkirchen&lt;/em&gt;. Yes, I agree with you, this village should&apos;ve been called &lt;em&gt;Traun Town&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gmunden is a very lively town with a lot of summer resorts, shops, art galleries and restaurants. Curiosly, most of the fashion boutiques exclusively had austrian regional constumes on display on the storefronts. I left there with a real desire to buy one, they were splendid. During our visit it was very peaceful, but it was clear that it&apos;s a popular tourist destination. The old town is surrounded by countless houses of all sizes from modest chalets to small palaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the western lakeside, in front of the mouth of the Traun River and connected with the downtown through the Esplananade (a nice long promenade) is located the biggest attraction of the town: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schloss_Ort&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schloss Ort Castle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This singular Austrian Castle is set on a small island offshore, so it can only be reached by a long timber bridge. This 120m bridge starts from a beautiful green peninsula called the &lt;strong&gt;Toscana Park&lt;/strong&gt;. We took a delightful walk through the park by the water&apos;s edge where each stop seemed a special viewpoint and provided a unique perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2017/06/Gmunden_Schloss_Ort.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gmunden&apos;s Schloss Ort Castle&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had dinner at the &lt;em&gt;Weinhaus Spiesberger&lt;/em&gt;, conceivably the best tavern in town where Agatha dined, guess what, &lt;em&gt;Traun Fische&lt;/em&gt;! We did not quite understand what kind of fish it was, as in the UK when you order &lt;em&gt;Fish &amp;amp; chips&lt;/em&gt; and almost nobody is capable of telling you the specific type of fish. Anyway, it was a seasonal fish from the Lake (or so the said) and it was good so I also recommend this place at least for a beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay tuned for next episodes!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Romantikstraße, the Romantic Road (1 of 5)</title>
      <link>https://luisgc.github.io/blog/2017/05/Romantikstrasse-the-Romantic-Road_1.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">2017/05/Romantikstrasse-the-Romantic-Road_1.html</guid>
      	<description>
	&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I had the immense pleasure of making a road trip through Austria following what they call the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.romantikstrasse.at/es/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romantikstraße&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Romantic Road&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Romantic Trail&lt;/em&gt; in English. Interestingly, ours was a &lt;strong&gt;singles&lt;/strong&gt; trip initially planned for three friends but sadly in the end we were only two because at the last minute Roberto had to cancel. I shared this great adventure only with &lt;strong&gt;Agatha&lt;/strong&gt; and it was great (as expected). I suppose that in the eyes of any innkeeper or bartender we were a happy couple celebrating something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I didn&apos;t notice any special &lt;em&gt;romantic atmosphere&lt;/em&gt; beyond the surrounding beautiful landscapes, fantastic lakes and awesome mountains. Some might say that my sense of romanticism is broken, and it may be possible, but for me Nature is not romantic by itself. Luckily the shops, restaurants and villages in general didn&apos;t focus on selling this concept to the visitors. In fact it was very unlikely to find a sign about the Romantikstraße off the main roads of the route. But enough talking about the commercial name of the route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me summarize our experience, mainly anecdotes and tips. Prices, timetables and other General tourist information are easy to find and that info sometimes expires soon. I&apos;ll love to read it in the future and it could be useful for anyone planning a similar trip. You can also read &lt;a href=&quot;https://detintasuelta.blogspot.com.es/2017/05/romantikstrasse-por-austria.html&quot;&gt;Agatha&apos;s review in her blog&lt;/a&gt; (in Spanish). She &lt;a href=&quot;https://detintasuelta.blogspot.com.es/2017/02/preparando-la-romantikstrasse-por.html&quot;&gt;prepared the route perfectly in advance&lt;/a&gt; and we mainly followed her plan, we only needed a couple of improvised detours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The area covered by the Romantikstraße is totally amazing. &lt;strong&gt;Everything is beautiful&lt;/strong&gt;, looks shiny, deserves a zillion pictures or to sit for a while to admire the landscape. Especially the latter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It&apos;s &lt;strong&gt;not a cheap trip&lt;/strong&gt;, but it&apos;s not as expensive as Switzerland&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We spent 4,5 days there and it was enough but the trip &lt;strong&gt;deserves at least a couple days more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hallstatt is very beautiful, but it&apos;s not (as they claim) the &lt;strong&gt;most beautiful village in the world&lt;/strong&gt;. Covarrubias is (of course)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Preparing the Romantikstraße&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not as lucky as I was and you need to prepare the trip in advance, my first recommendation is to visit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.romantikstrasse.at/en/&quot;&gt;official website of the Romantikstraße&lt;/a&gt;. There you&apos;ll find a lot of info about the route and the main attractions. You can also request a brochure of the route in several languages for free, we did it and it was useful during the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the accommodation, depending on the dates of the trip it may be essential to book everything in advance. Some villages are very small and have few options to choose from. We booked in advance only the first night and a couple of nights we needed a considerable detour from the route, and it was low season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Day 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Schallaburg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After wasting more than 1 hour in the airport waiting the queue of the car rental company our first destination was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schallaburg.at/en?set_language=en&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schallaburg Castle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a &amp;gt;900 years old castle very well preserved located on top of a hill surrounded by forest. In addition to the privileged situation, the castle offers a very well arranged garden. This first stop reminded me of my bicycle trip through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cycling-loire.com/&quot;&gt;La Loire à Vélo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The castle also hosts temporal exibitions and a very nice restaurant in the courtyard called &lt;em&gt;Schloss&lt;/em&gt;. Apart from the regional specialities, the restaurant changes it&apos;s menu and decoration to match the running exibitions. During our visit the main exhibition was about Islam and we could acclimitize to the country with a regional craft beer and some falafel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first funny anecdote of the trip arrived soon. From the parking to the castle we saw two different roads, both very steep. Ignoring a medium-sized sign in german we followed the nearest of them, because in &lt;a href=&quot;http://osmand.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OSMAnd&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I could see that it was more direct to the gardens and the castle. After visiting the garden, the courtyard of the castle, the restaurant and most of the open rooms (and some closed ones), we noticed that we had paid nothing to be there. We went back to the parking lot using the other way and confirmed that we&apos;d skipped the ticket office. I leave to your imagination if we warned them of our mistake and paid the entrance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2017/05/Schallaburg_castle_courtyard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Schallaburg castle&apos;s courtyard&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before leaving, we found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=dc7d5446-009c-4332-8fde-2881d06a4882&quot;&gt;our first cache of the trip&lt;/a&gt;, less than 5 meters from our car :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Melk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next visit was to Melk and his famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melk_Abbey&quot;&gt;Melk Abbey&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umberto_Eco&quot;&gt;Umberto Eco&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;em&gt;Adso de Melk&lt;/em&gt; as a tribute to this abbey, and we were curious about it and the fact that the Austrians talk about this place as one of the most important monasteries in Europe. The place did not dissapoint us at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did a quick tour through the main elements of this baroque Abbey. The exhibition, the Marble Hall and the church are quite beautiful but what really impressed us was the Library, with about 100.000 volumes (1.888 manuscripts, 750 incunabula, a unique 13th century copy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibelungenlied&quot;&gt;The Song of the Nibelungs&lt;/a&gt;, ...). In one room of the Library the fresco portrays an allegory of Scientia (Science), just like churches in Spain, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/img/2017/05/Melk_Abbey_Library.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Melk Abbey Library&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Abbey was also wisely located, on top of a hill and clearly standing out from the town of Melk. The visit is worth it just for the views from the balcony connecting the Marble Hall and the Library with Melk, the Danube river and forests everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visit to the Abbey includes a nice English landscape garden with an interesting baroque pavilion and a small park full of works of art and fabulous hidden corners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t forget to find &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC5X2KR_tb-hotel-der-kescherinnen?guid=7e33fa4c-f4a2-4ac9-b11a-ee13d2db9a03&quot;&gt;this awesome cache&lt;/a&gt; in the surrounding area. One of my all time favorites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Steyr&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our last stop for the first day was Steyr, where (as they say) &lt;em&gt;Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo meet each other in harmony&lt;/em&gt;. Steyr is in the confluence of the rivers Enns and Steyr, and therefore features more than 100 bridges. I confess that I expected to hear the comment &lt;em&gt;The Venice of Austria&lt;/em&gt; but it didn&apos;t happen. The old town is nice, all around the huge Stadtplatz (market square) that was, saldy, partially ocuppied with parked cars and even some tents for private events. Disgusting for the visitors and I&apos;d bet that also for the locals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our main goal in this city was to follow the &lt;strong&gt;Nachtwächtern Tour&lt;/strong&gt;, a walking tour through the old town guided by a historian disguised as medieval watchman. Unluckily the tour was only in german, and we struggled to get the guide to understand that we wanted to follow him without understanding anything at all. The guide took pity on us, letting us follow him paying &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; half the price. As expected we didn&apos;t understand anything, but we crossed the same streets and alleys, we looked where they looked, we analyzed in detail whatever they commented in detail, and we laughed when they laughed (maybe even some joke about Spanish tourists, who knows).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Night Watchman Tour is also the only way for a tourist to climb the 228 steps of the &lt;strong&gt;Stadtpfarrkirche Steyr&lt;/strong&gt; tower, a roman catholic Church dedicated to Saint Aegidius (I toast him!) and Saint Koloman. Even at night, the views are wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a delicious dinner with local specialities at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/270488531&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mader&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and returned to our guest house (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3119352500&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gasthof Bauer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). I recommend both places but especially the second one, the guest house ocuppied several low buildings and houses in a small island near the old town, the rooms were almost small apartments and the attention we received was exquisite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first part of my chronicle about our trip through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.romantikstrasse.at/es/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romantikstraße&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you can read the rest here:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Baking my Blog with JBake and GitHub</title>

      	<description>
	&lt;p&gt;Almost since &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2003/10/arranca-luiyologa.html&quot;&gt;I created my personal blog&lt;/a&gt; in 2003 I thought about moving it from blogger to my own domain, private hosting and so on. My lazyness prevented me from doing so. Not because the migration itself, but for the maintenance it entailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I was determined to migrate my blog outside of any blogging platform. I wanted to have complete control over my content, but without wasting lots of time in maintenance. All I needed was a way to do it seamlessly, quickly, and as automated as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The static site/blog generators appeared a long time ago but now they are multiplying and flourishing. I watched them and the surrounding tools for a long time... and recently my atheist prayers were heard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will describe briefly what I did &lt;strong&gt;to move my blog from blogger to Github Pages in a few hours&lt;/strong&gt;. The most time consuming task was to decide among a large number of excellent static site generators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1 - Choose your weapon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reference here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.staticgen.com/&quot;&gt;StaticGen&lt;/a&gt;, a ranking with all the open source static site generators. The site itself is open source, and static generated (of course) using &lt;a href=&quot;http://middlemanapp.com/&quot;&gt;Middleman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;StaticGen&lt;/em&gt; you will need some time, filtering by programming language, sorting the options by stars, forks, ... Eventually you&apos;ll chose one that covers your needs mainly in terms of language, templating technology or license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was tempted to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://gohugo.io/&quot;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; but I selected &lt;a href=&quot;http://jbake.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JBake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (created in 2013 by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jonathanbullock.com/&quot;&gt;Jonathan Bullock&lt;/a&gt;) instead of other much more popular options. The main reasons for me were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It&apos;s &lt;strong&gt;Open Source&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT&quot;&gt;MIT License&lt;/a&gt;). This is always the first element in my checklist&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It&apos;s &lt;strong&gt;cross platform&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the main benefits to choose a product running in the JVM, right?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supports a good amount of &lt;strong&gt;content formats&lt;/strong&gt;: plain HTML, &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://asciidoctor.org/&quot;&gt;AsciiDoc&lt;/a&gt;, ... this is great now that I write even my personal notes in markdown format&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interesting &lt;strong&gt;template support&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://freemarker.org/&quot;&gt;Freemarker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thymeleaf.org/&quot;&gt;Thymeleaf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/neuland/jade4j&quot;&gt;Jade&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.groovy-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Groovy template framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blog-ready&lt;/strong&gt; out of the box: RSS feed, tag support, archive, index pagination, ...&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easy to integrate with &lt;strong&gt;CSS frameworks&lt;/strong&gt; as &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbootstrap.com/&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Custom metadata&lt;/strong&gt; in the contents, even exposed to the templates. This is winner by itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://jbake.org/docs/&quot;&gt;documentation of JBake&lt;/a&gt; could be improved, but it&apos;s good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install JBake, you can execute &lt;a href=&quot;http://jbake.org/download.html&quot;&gt;the last binary distribution&lt;/a&gt; but I recommend that you simply use &lt;a href=&quot;http://sdkman.io/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SDKMAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If you don&apos;t know what SDKMAN is, you are missing something special. After you have SDKMAN installed, enter the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; sdk install jbake
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks Jonathan !!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2 - Choose your theme/style&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some static generators support themes better than others, that&apos;s for sure. This was important to me, and I checked that in &lt;em&gt;JBake&lt;/em&gt; the code responsible of the presentation is isolated enough from the content, so it&apos;s more or less simple to change entirely the theme or style of your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I didn&apos;t start the personalization of my blog from the default theme and style. I cloned the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/manikmagar/jbake-future-imperfect-template&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JBake Future Imperfect Template&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/manikmagar&quot;&gt;Manik Magar&lt;/a&gt; and for the moment I&apos;ve only needed minor touches to make it better suited for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As simple as this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;shell&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; mkdir awesome-jbake

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; git clone https://github.com/manikmagar/jbake-future-imperfect-template.git awesome-jbake

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; cd awesome-jbake &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ls -ltr
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the changes were related to custom css styles that I was already using in Blogger, the &lt;em&gt;JBake Future Imperfect Template&lt;/em&gt; is fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks Manik !!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 3 - Migrate your content from your old blog/site (if needed)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&apos;ll only need this if you are migrating something, skip this point if you are creating something from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this magic trick, my first intent was to implement it myself, only to code for a while. Finally I discovered a repo in github with a promising name: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cloudtu/blogger-to-jbake&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blogger-to-jbake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I checked the code and the author (&lt;a href=&quot;http://cloudtu.github.io/&quot;&gt;Cloud Tu&lt;/a&gt;) had developed more or less what I meant to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a little help from an &lt;em&gt;difficult-even-for-google-translate&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;README&lt;/code&gt; file in Chinese, I could run the program and export all my blog only with minor problems regarding the download of certain images that were not hosted in blogger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steps are very simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Modify the &lt;code&gt;src/main/resources/application.properties&lt;/code&gt; to set the Blogger atom file path, the output path and your current URL in Blogger&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Execute &lt;code&gt;gradlew run&lt;/code&gt; in the console&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Profit!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made some improvements (from my humble point of view) in the code, and I&apos;ll send the corresponding pull request. They could be valuable for anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks Cloud Tu !!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 4 - Deploy your blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, thanks to Github and specifically to &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;, the only thing that I needed was to change the configuration of JBake so the output directory for the &lt;em&gt;baked&lt;/em&gt; content is called &lt;code&gt;docs&lt;/code&gt; instead of the name by default (&lt;code&gt;output&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/&quot;&gt;enabling it for the first time&lt;/a&gt;, Github automatically deploys in Github Pages whatever you put in the &lt;code&gt;docs&lt;/code&gt; directory of your repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m suffering the misbehaviour of Github Pages with relative paths, but for the moment I&apos;m solving it with a sed command before pushing the baked content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks Github Pages !!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m happier than ever with my blog, and I&apos;ll try to write more often now that I can make it with my editor in Markdown or AsciiDoc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s also possible that I&apos;ll write a more technical post about how JBake works, but in the meantime ask me in the comments anything that you want to know.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;i&gt;I&apos;ll keep my intent to summarize all the important events that I&apos;m attending, and I&apos;ll do it again in English as the audience is international. &lt;b&gt;Please, point me any mistake you may find&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;a href=&quot;http://2017.greachconf.com/&quot;&gt;Greach 2017&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I attended, as usual since I don&apos;t remember when, to &lt;a href=&quot;http://2017.greachconf.com/&quot;&gt;Greach 2017&lt;/a&gt;, an international conference about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.groovy-lang.org/&quot;&gt;Apache Groovy language&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.groovy-lang.org/ecosystem.html&quot;&gt;ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;. Greach is held each year in Madrid but everything is in English, and nowadays it&apos;s probably one of the Top3 worldwide events about this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event is organized mainly by &lt;a href=&quot;http://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&amp;amp;jsonp=vglnk_149113158632914&amp;amp;key=fc09da8d2ec4b1af80281370066f19b1&amp;amp;libId=j10kgw3v01012xfw000DLef6729tbp6er&amp;amp;loc=http%3A%2F%2Fluiyo.blogspot.com.es%2F2016%2F04%2Fgreach-2016-groovy-spanish-conference.html&amp;amp;v=1&amp;amp;out=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Filopmar&amp;amp;title=Luiyolog%C3%ADa%3A%20Greach%202016%2C%20the%20Groovy%20Spanish%20conference&amp;amp;txt=%3Cb%3EIv%C3%A1n%20L%C3%B3pez%3C%2Fb%3E%20(%40ilopar)&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Iván López&lt;/b&gt; (@ilopar)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&amp;amp;jsonp=vglnk_149113160190015&amp;amp;key=fc09da8d2ec4b1af80281370066f19b1&amp;amp;libId=j10kgw3v01012xfw000DLef6729tbp6er&amp;amp;loc=http%3A%2F%2Fluiyo.blogspot.com.es%2F2016%2F04%2Fgreach-2016-groovy-spanish-conference.html&amp;amp;v=1&amp;amp;out=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Falbertovilches&amp;amp;title=Luiyolog%C3%ADa%3A%20Greach%202016%2C%20the%20Groovy%20Spanish%20conference&amp;amp;txt=%3Cb%3EAlberto%20Vilches%3C%2Fb%3E%20(%40albertovilches)&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alberto Vilches&lt;/b&gt; (@albertovilches)&lt;/a&gt;, with some help from other colleagues and &lt;a href=&quot;http://2017.greachconf.com/#tile_sponsors&quot;&gt;a lot of Sponsors&lt;/a&gt;. Everything was perfect: the location is great, the spaces were confortable, the wifi more or less worked fine, cafeteria in-place, free wardrobe,... the lunch boxes were far from perfect, but that&apos;s another story more related to the venue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TLDR;&lt;/b&gt; The conference content and speakers were great, in addition to the logistics. I missed the workshop day, but everyone told me it was also fantastic (both venue and contents). I learned a lot, not only about Groovy or Grails, but also about GraphQL, Ratpack and concurrence in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me summarize some of the talks I attended:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2017.greachconf.com/sessions/make-concurrency-groovy-again/&quot;&gt;Make concurrency groovy again&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href=&quot;http://2017.greachconf.com/speakers/alonso-torres/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alonso Torres&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alotor&quot;&gt;@alotor&lt;/a&gt;). Alonso gave an excellent overview of the main available resources regarding concurrence in the Groovy ecosystem, comparing some of them in terms of design, code readability and even performance. Threads, functional style resources, parallel collections, Atomic variables, fork/join, GPars, actors... and even how to steal a bit from others (Clojure, Akka or Spark) thanks to the Java bindings. Take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/alotor/greach-17-make-concurrency-groovy-again&quot;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Another hands-on master class by Iván, combining and comparing some of the benefits of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.javaslang.io/&quot;&gt;Javaslang&lt;/a&gt; with what&apos;s available out-of-the-box in Groovy. The demo part (90% of the talk) covered a lot of interesting examples: Optional vs Option, Try, Functional Interfaces, Tuples, Javaslang collections, Pattern matching, validations, ...&lt;/li&gt;

Noam gave a complete review of the features included in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/http-builder-ng/http-builder-ng&quot;&gt;HTTP Builder NG&lt;/a&gt;, the current available implementations and some advanced features and use cases like header parsers, content parsers, request interceptors or request encoders&lt;/li&gt;

Burt gave this talk for the first time in 2010 at the Spring One, pointing out some performance problems when mapping collections with any ORM tool (like GORM or Hibernate). After seven years, he revisited the topic repeating (sadly) the same warnings about more or less the same problems, some of them critical with huge data collections&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2017.greachconf.com/sessions/graphql-development-with-groovy/&quot;&gt;GraphQL development with Groovy&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href=&quot;http://2017.greachconf.com/speakers/mario-garcia/&quot;&gt;Mario García&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/marioggar&quot;&gt;@marioggar&lt;/a&gt;). Thanks to Mario now I have a clear view of what &lt;a href=&quot;http://graphql.org/&quot;&gt;GraphQL&lt;/a&gt; provides, and specially what it does not provide. He reviewed the main features, the logic behind schemas, types querying, hierarchy, operations, the introspective nature of GraphQL... Mario also demoed some useful combination of GraphQL with tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/graphql/graphiql&quot;&gt;GraphiQL&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/relay/&quot;&gt;Relay&lt;/a&gt;. He even teased &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/grooviter/gql&quot;&gt;GQL&lt;/a&gt;, his own DSL library to use GraphQL directly from Groovy. Awesome :-)&lt;/li&gt;

Ryan also showed how he uses Grails apps to create Alexa services and cards, and how to test them online with &lt;a href=&quot;https://echosim.io/&quot;&gt;Echosim.io&lt;/a&gt;. Very interesting, and one of those talks in which the audience leaves with some good ideas for the future&lt;/li&gt;

Regarding &lt;a href=&quot;http://gorm.grails.org/&quot;&gt;GORM&lt;/a&gt;, the main things for the 6.1 version are: Improvements in common AST transforms, common services, and Data Services, package scanning and a better mapping DSL. Graeme showed some of the new features and they looked amazing, very good work :-)&lt;/li&gt;

Marcin gave us some tips to make a better use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gebish.org/&quot;&gt;Geb&lt;/a&gt;, starting with the reminder that a Module is a Navigator, that Navigators are iterable, and the advantages of overloading some methods, having dynamic base urls or page parametrizations. He also explained how to inject Javascript into pages (if needed). Other best practices: using strongly typed Geb code, tracking the current page type, always keep the &lt;i&gt;at&lt;/i&gt; checks simple and quick and that modules are not meant only for reuse but also to isolate complex blocks.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Como cada arranque de año toca revisar los datos sobre las partidas que he jugado durante el año anterior (enlace a los datos de &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2016/01/mi-2015-ludico.html&quot;&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/01/mi-2014-ludico.html&quot;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2014/01/partidas-jugadas-en-2013.html&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2013/01/partidas-jugadas-en-2012.html&quot;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt; y &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/01/juegos-los-que-mas-he-jugado-en-2011.html&quot;&gt;2011&lt;/a&gt;).

  Partidas Jugadas por Mes hasta 2016
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Análisis:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Este 2016 he jugado más que en los dos años anteriores, aunque no tengo esa sensación porque el número de sesiones es parecido (30 en 2015 vs &lt;b&gt;35&lt;/b&gt; en 2016)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;En 2016 he probado 25 juegos nuevos, siguen siendo bastantes pero una proporción mucho menor que otros años. Se nota que he repetido mucho a algunos juegos (casi un tercio de las partidas fueron a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic&quot;&gt;Pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161936/pandemic-legacy-season-1&quot;&gt;Pandemic Legacy&lt;/a&gt; o &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames&quot;&gt;Código Secreto&lt;/a&gt;). Bastante en línea con las &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1697948/bgg-2016-end-year-stats-plays&quot;&gt;estadísticas globales sobre partidas jugadas que publicó la BGG hace unos días&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;La experiencia con &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161936/pandemic-legacy-season-1&quot;&gt;la temporada 1 de Pandemic Legacy&lt;/a&gt; está siendo fabulosa. Cada vez juego más a cooperativos y cada vez me atraen más los juegos que permiten cierta repetición y continuación a base de reglas &lt;i&gt;legacy&lt;/i&gt; o campañas en general&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Aparte de lo relativo a juegos de mesa y rol, durante 2016 tengo registradas más de &lt;b&gt;150h&lt;/b&gt; en &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Steam&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (de un total de 393.3h). Es altamente improbable que en 2017 pueda mantener esas cifras (de hecho, apenas juego desde el verano pasado)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Como dato nuevo en este análisis, mi &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;h-index&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; como jugador ha subido a &lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt; después de unos años estancado en 10. Dato curioso, aunque poco útil :-P&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Retrospectiva:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Si mi tiempo de ocio ya era limitado en 2016... este año que comienza será peor aún. Veremos qué tal lo voy llevando&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Sigo sin haber podido retomar la campaña que dirigía con &lt;a href=&quot;http://rpggeek.com/rpg/4395/one-ring&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;El Anillo Único&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, y tampoco he podido comenzar a dirigir partidas nuevas a &lt;a href=&quot;http://rpggeek.com/rpg/10154/aventuras-en-la-marca-del-este&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aventuras en la Marca del Este&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; o &lt;a href=&quot;http://rpggeek.com/rpg/21555/baker-street-rpg&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Baker Street RPG&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. En 2017 debería intentar hacer algo al respecto&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Siguiendo la triste dinámica que comencé el año pasado, este año no he jugado apenas a prototipos. Sigo perteneciendo a la &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asociacionludo.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Asociación Ludo&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pero ni pude ir al &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asociacionludo.com/blog/2015/02/10/encuentro-de-protos-y-tipos-2015/&quot;&gt;IV Encuentro de Protos y Tipos&lt;/a&gt; ni he podido ir las reuniones con los compañeros de Madrid. Lo hecho mucho de menos pero por desgracia sigue sin ser prioritario ahora mismo :-(&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      	<description>
	
&lt;p&gt;Para mantener la &lt;i&gt;buena costumbre&lt;/i&gt; (ya, lo sé, no siempre cumplo), voy a relatar brevemente mi experiencia durante &lt;a href=&quot;https://2016.codemotion.es/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Codemotion 2016&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, uno de los eventos sobre informática y programación más importantes del país. No hay números oficiales definitivos pero en la clausura la organización comentó que hubo &lt;b&gt;más de 2.000 asistentes&lt;/b&gt; y &lt;b&gt;más de 150 charlas/talleres&lt;/b&gt;. Suelo asistir todos los años, hay otros eventos más potentes e interesantes para tecnologías concretas pero como evento generalista donde puedes ver y oír de todo creo que Codemotion hoy en día no tiene rival (al menos en España).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TLDR;&lt;/b&gt; Después de haber dado &lt;b&gt;dos&lt;/b&gt; charlas el año pasado en &lt;a href=&quot;https://2015.codemotion.es/&quot;&gt;Codemotion 2015&lt;/a&gt; este año me lo tomé con mucha tranquilidad. Disfruté de muy buenas charlas (otras no tanto, lo normal) y en general me fui con buen sabor de boca. &lt;b&gt;Nota positiva&lt;/b&gt; para la organización: hubo menos atascos en los pasillos y menos problemas de aforo en las salas. &lt;b&gt;Nota negativa&lt;/b&gt;: sigue sin haber suficiente presencia de mujeres ponentes en el evento y la gestión del tema sigue dejando bastante que desear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leyendo las crónicas de otros asistentes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://codeurjc.wordpress.com/2016/11/21/mi-experiencia-en-codemotion-2016/&quot;&gt;la de &lt;b&gt;Micael Gallego&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, por ejemplo) me doy cuenta una vez más de que no hago suficiente networking en estos eventos. Es una pena no aprovechar la ocasión, me crucé con mucha gente conocida: antiguos compañeros, conocidos virtuales, amigos de amigos, etc. Una buena conversación con algunos de ellos bien vale perderse una charla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vamos con mi resumen, aprovechando el feedback que he dejado a cada ponente sobre su charla:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2016.codemotion.es/agenda.html#5732408326356992/90194003&quot;&gt;Los androides no sueñan con ovejas eléctricas; sueñan con conciliar&lt;/a&gt;, por &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/smorcuende&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Susana Morcuende&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/yamila_moreno&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yamila Moreno&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; y &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jorgeas80&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jorge Arévalo&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Charla muy necesaria, Susana explicó perfectamente en qué consiste la conciliación, y Yamila y Jorge relataron cómo persiguen este objetivo en sus respectivas empresas: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kaleidosnet&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kaleidos&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; y &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pronoide&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pronoide&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Destaco como ellos que &lt;i&gt;conciliar&lt;/i&gt; no es exclusivo de familias con hijos, todos deberíamos estar preocupados en mantener un correcto balance entre la vida laboral y la personal.&lt;/li&gt;

Muy buena charla, divertida y útil. Resulta difícil hacer una charla amena sobre un tema a priori áspero, pero Jesús lo bordó a base de entusiasmo y pasión por &lt;b&gt;Vim&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
 &lt;i&gt;I&apos;ll keep my intent to summarize all the important events that I&apos;m attending, and I&apos;ll do it again in English as the audience is international. &lt;b&gt;Please, point me any mistake you may find&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last weekend I had the opportunity to attend &lt;a href=&quot;http://greachconf.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Greach 2016&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;b&gt;Greach&lt;/b&gt; is an international conference about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.groovy-lang.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Groovy&lt;/b&gt; language&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.groovy-lang.org/ecosystem.html&quot;&gt;ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;, it&apos;s hosted here in Madrid but the conference is 100% in English to successfully attract top speakers and attendees. This was the &lt;b&gt;5th edition&lt;/b&gt; of the conference, consolidated as one of the biggest events worldwide about Groovy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TLDR;&lt;/b&gt; You shouldn&apos;t miss this gathering if you have a minimum interest in this technology. Top speakers and high quality content are guaranteed in a confortable and thought provoking environment. &lt;b&gt;Totally worth it&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything was (as expected) brilliantly organized thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ilopmar&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Iván López&lt;/b&gt; (@ilopar)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/albertovilches&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alberto Vilches&lt;/b&gt; (@albertovilches)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://greachconf.com/#sponsors&quot;&gt;a lot of Sponsors&lt;/a&gt;. The venue changed from previous years, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.teatrosluchana.es/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Teatros Luchana&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was also a success. Both auditoriums and networking space had the proper dimensions, very good location, a very handy cafeteria, free wardrobe, more than decent food,... Maybe the sponsors area could have been larger, but everything else was more than correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me summarize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://greachconf.com/speakers/guillaume-laforge-a-groovy-journey-in-open-source/&quot;&gt;A Groovy journey in Open Source&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href=&quot;http://glaforge.appspot.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guillaume Laforge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/glaforge&quot;&gt;@glaforge&lt;/a&gt;, Apache Groovy Project VP). Guillaume made an interesting overview of Groovy&apos;s history, from its birth in 2003 to its current status as a top Open Source programming language inside the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Apache Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, remarking some of the main milestones. The audience particularly appreciated when he explained extensively about the current situation, when no one has the maintenance and evoultion of Groovy as its full-time paid job.&lt;/li&gt;

Søren made a nice introduction to &lt;b&gt;Grails&lt;/b&gt;, explaining what comes out-of-the-box: GORM, a rich controller layer, GSPs technology, an embedded Tomcat, on-the-fly reloading, Spring DI, i18n, transactional services control, easy taglib generation, Gradle and a useful command line tool.&lt;/li&gt;

I received more than I expected, it was a great talk about advanced tips and tricks using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gebish.org/&quot;&gt;Geb&lt;/a&gt; for testing automation. Pro tip: extending GebReportingSpec to make captures before and after each test.&lt;/li&gt;

Noam emphasized (as expected) the importance of clean code, focusing on how Groovy itself can improve our codebase: JSON native support, checked exceptions, default imports, AST transformations, extension modules, scripts,...&lt;/li&gt;

Burt showed a lot of internal features of &lt;a href=&quot;https://grails.github.io/grails-doc/latest/guide/GORM.html&quot;&gt;GORM&lt;/a&gt;, and how he is arranging some useful improvements in a promising open source library (which will be published shortly).&lt;/li&gt;

Olga started with an interesting reflection about the absence of contract compliance in REST, and its importance in microservice-based systems. Do we need to test all after the release of any microservice? Do we test them independently mocking everything else? How will we notice if a contract changes? The last part of her talk was an introduction to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Codearte/accurest&quot;&gt;Accurest&lt;/a&gt;, a Gradle plugin to create REST contracts and to verify its compliance with automatically generated Spock tests. Very promising.&lt;/li&gt;

Alex started with the principles behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery&quot;&gt;CD&lt;/a&gt;: deliver faster, sooner and better. Then he remarked the main idea of agile: Deliver business value more frequently. After that, he metioned some interesting tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/serenity-bdd&quot;&gt;Serenity&lt;/a&gt; to make BDD or &lt;a href=&quot;http://gatling.io/&quot;&gt;Gatling&lt;/a&gt; for stress testing, and several tips to improve your CD using Gradle and Jenkins.&lt;/li&gt;

Andrés uses Groovy mainly for testing and scripting, and explained some examples of how Groovy makes his day thanks to its dynamic nature. As an example he showed, demo included, how he makes dynamic curl petitions using Groovy&apos;s JsonRpcClient.&lt;/li&gt;

In this interesting keynote Graeme talked about the upcoming Grails 3 and its importance in the future. How Grails has adapted to the current and future needs through diverse and powerful profiles (rest-api, angular, plugin, web-plugin,...). He made an overview of the REST API profile and it looked awesome: No GSP, specific plugins, specific ui plugins, extensible and customizable Json/Markup views,... Brilliant and very useful.&lt;/li&gt;

Andrés gave a complete review, live demo included, of several plugins for &lt;a href=&quot;http://gradle.org/&quot;&gt;Gradle&lt;/a&gt;. I will highlight some of them: versions (to manage dependencies), license (to update license headers and even download the license docs), versioning (to add the git hash to the project manifest), coveralls (produces an awesome report on coverage) and another to publish generated docs (with ascii doctor, for example) automatically to gh-pages in Github.&lt;/li&gt;

Mario dared to talk about AST Transformations, giving an extraordinary explanation of the theory behind them, showing a lot of code and sharing several good &amp;amp; bad experiences with them. He explained when and why its a good idea to apply ASTTs, some improvement tips and even tricks to reduce your AST code using ASTTs or combining them. Impressive as usual.&lt;/li&gt;

Stephan explained &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sclassen/asciidoctorj-screenshot&quot;&gt;Asciidoctor&apos;s screenshot extension&lt;/a&gt;, and how easy it may be used with &lt;b&gt;Geb&lt;/b&gt; to improve your documentation updating automatically every capture in your manuals after each build. Stephan also explained how the conversion process of &lt;a href=&quot;http://asciidoctor.org/&quot;&gt;AsciiDoctor&lt;/a&gt; works, in order to hack any step to adapt the resulting document. Very useful info :-)&lt;/li&gt;

I loved this contest, entertainment at its finest and very very educational. It&apos;s based on the mythic &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.javapuzzlers.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Java Puzzlers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tradition created by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.javapuzzlers.com/bios.html&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joshua Bloch&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Neal Gafter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but migrated to Groovy mainly by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jbaruch&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;JBaruch&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Some intriguing blocks of Groovy code are shown and the audience needs to choose between 4 possible outputs. Obviously it&apos;s easy to miss, but hard not to laugh and learn afterwards. Hilarious.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Disclaimer: I attended FOSDEM in Brussels last January. I should have written this weeks ago but better late than ever, right?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;image lateral&quot;&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2016/03/fosdem-2016-friday.html&quot;&gt;FOSDEM 2016: Friday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2016/03/fosdem-2016-saturday.html&quot;&gt;FOSDEM 2016: Saturday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;b&gt;retrospective&lt;/b&gt;, I attended a lot of talks and almost all of them were very interesting, but looking back now I realize that I should&apos;ve spent more time in the stands and aisles. I expected to do networking when forced by room capacity issues, but luckily we never suffered this problem despite attending some overcrowded talks (with a lot of people having to stay outside). Perhaps it wasn&apos;t so bad, because even so I spent a lot of money on textile products :-D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Sunday ended being much like the day before. A large majority of the talks I attended were in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/track/legal_and_policy_issues/&quot;&gt;Legal and Policy Issues&lt;/a&gt; track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me summarize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;spacious&quot;&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/geo_gnome/&quot;&gt;Building a geo-aware Operating System&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://zee-nix.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zeeshan Ali&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/zeenix&quot;&gt;@zeenix&lt;/a&gt;, Gnome developer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redhat.com/&quot;&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;). I was very thrilled with this talk, but it didn&apos;t meet my expectations. Zeeshan (and others) have developed great tools for the Gnome desktop: &lt;b&gt;geoclue&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;geocode-glib&lt;/b&gt; and the integration with &lt;b&gt;GNOME Maps&lt;/b&gt; seemed great, but I expected some less obvious features (from the functional point of view, of course) than locating yourself on a map. Having said that, geo-awareness in mobile devices was a total revolution, and I&apos;m sure sooner or later it&apos;ll also be strongly reflected in our desktops&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/geo_gsoc/&quot;&gt;Results of Google Summer of Code 2015 at OSGeo&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;b&gt;Anne Ghisla&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Margherita Di Leo&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/&quot;&gt;Google Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt; tutors). Being a member of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;OpenStreetMap Foundation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://hdyc.neis-one.org/?Luiyo&quot;&gt;an addicted mapper&lt;/a&gt;, I felt the need to attend this talk. It ended up being an enumeration of projects, without the necessary detail to make the explanation amusing or interesting. At least I recognize that they talked about GSoC with great enthusiasm, made me want to participate at some point&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/foundations_threat/&quot;&gt;Open source foundations: threat or menace?&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;b&gt;Richard Fontana&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/richardfontana&quot;&gt;@richardfontana&lt;/a&gt;, IP, Open Source and Patent lawyer at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redhat.com/&quot;&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;). Mr Fontana gave us a very interesting and thought provoking talk. After a brief explanation about legal differences between 501(c)(3) vs. 501(c)(6) foundation types in the US (and why some Open Source foundations have chosen one or the other), he detailed his concerns about the work carried out by some foundations:
  &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Sometimes foundations drive to an &lt;i&gt;illusion&lt;/i&gt; of property&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;We have seen examples of foundations &quot;&lt;i&gt;artificially&lt;/i&gt;&quot; prolonging the life of a project, which is not always positive&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Some Open Source projects receive legal support by foundations and liability protection, but he explained that it should only apply if the foundation is &lt;b&gt;in charge&lt;/b&gt; of what the project (or volunteer) does. Sometimes foundations (like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apache.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Apache Software Foundation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://eclipse.org/org/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eclipse Foundation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) presume of the independence of their projects, and this is a contradiction&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Foundations serving only as right holders in trademark issues&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;In some foundations there is not a clear barrier between business management and technical management, as it should be&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Sometimes, the amount of power inside a foundation is derived by the amount of money donated (in cash or man hours), this gives the message that the project from those foundations are &lt;b&gt;for sale&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/safety_critical_foss/&quot;&gt;Status of safety-critical FOSS&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jeremiah&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jeremiah C. Foster&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/miahfost&quot;&gt;@miahfost&lt;/a&gt;). Back in the Legal DevRoom, Jeremiah gave us a very interesting talk starting with a lot of information about safety-critical software and why it is important that software freedom becomes more present in this context. He also discussed it may be even possible to certify GNU/Linux at a safety-critical level, and how copyleft should be mandatory given that it provides more &lt;b&gt;transparency&lt;/b&gt; not only in the code itself but also in the entire development process. In GPLv3 licensed projects he explained some concerns about how the install info may require disclosure of the encryption keys used to sign a boot image. Another concern in the industry is that end users should not be able to modify embedded software in safety-critical systems.&lt;/li&gt;

Sumana gave a very well argued speech without media support, leaving clues of a probable theatrical past (or present). The basic comparison was that, just like the GPL restricts some developer&apos;s freedom (about redistributing under an incompatible license) to protect &lt;b&gt;all users&apos; freedom&lt;/b&gt; to use, inspect or modify the code, in the same way Codes of Conduct restrict some people&apos;s behaviour to increase &lt;b&gt;everyone&apos;s freedom&lt;/b&gt;. I share Sumana&apos;s point of view, also when she said that (&lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/conduct_and_copyleft/attachments/paper/1258/export/events/attachments/conduct_and_copyleft/paper/1258/fosdem_coc_copyleft_talk.html&quot;&gt;I quote&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;i&gt;we will make better software and have a greater impact if more people, and more different kinds of people, find our communities more appealing to work with&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Another brilliant talk, with the added bonus that James used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/impress/impress.js/&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Impress.js&lt;/a&gt; :-D James presented &lt;a href=&quot;http://developercertificate.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;DCO&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as an alternative to the popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement&quot;&gt;CLAs&lt;/a&gt;.

John did an interesting analysis of the current options to choose a software license, beginning with the claim that something has to be done because there are still a lot of projects without license but in a clever way to reduce the license proliferation. There are some guides (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-recommendations.html&quot;&gt;like the one the FSF itself has&lt;/a&gt;) which represent a significant barrier for most users. A lot of text with sometimes hard to understand differences between options. Apart from this approach, there are some popular tools like &lt;a href=&quot;http://choosealicense.com/&quot;&gt;choosealicense.com&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/choose/&quot;&gt;Creative Commons&apos; license chooser&lt;/a&gt;, but they also present several problems. The options order is important, the descriptions may be misleading, summaries are not fair... The QA turn was also brilliant, given that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bkeepers&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brandon Keepers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Open Source Lead in Github) was there to argue their position.&lt;/li&gt;

One of the recent examples: After the Nepal Earthquake in 2015, about 700 contributors using open source tools such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tasks.hotosm.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team&apos;s Tasking Manager&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; made &lt;b&gt;more than 13 million edits to OpenStreetMap&lt;/b&gt; in the first two weeks after the earthquake. Impressive, isn&apos;t it? He also described other tools and projects like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://export.hotosm.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;OpenStreetMap Export Tool&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.openaerialmap.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;OpenAerialMap&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; project, but as an active member of the OpenStreetMap group, I&apos;ll expand the information about this in future posts&lt;/li&gt;
