Any [**Goodreads**](https://www.goodreads.com/) user has access to a yearly report with some statistics and basically the covers of all the books read in one year. In order to have it the user only has to set the books as read and the _read date_ to any time in that year.

Taking advantage of this nice feature I will summarize my 2018 in books, given that not a lot of my people has an active Goodreads account.

According to [My 2018 in Books]([**Goodreads**](https://www.goodreads.com/)) from Goodreads:

* I read **7,224 pages** across **56 books**, a 112% of my 50 books read in 2018 goal
* The average length was **129 pages**
* My average rating was **3.7** (up to 5)
* The longest book I read was [_Patria_](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patria_(novel)), by [**Fernando Aramburu**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Aramburu)

The number or books is not very important, because some of the 56 are comics or short stories, but still 56 books is almost 5 books per month, that translates to one book per week approximately. Not bad, taking into account the other million of things that I do (or intend to do) every week.

I will not copy here the full list, Goodreads already does the accounting for me, but let me highlight some of them:
