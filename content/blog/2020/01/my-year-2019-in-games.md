Welcome again to this yearly post, where I try to analyze my gaming behavior during the previous year. I have been doing this since 2011 in Spanish, but this time I will do it in English as with the rest of my posts. You can read about my previous years:

## Analysis

* 2019 has been the year with less plays since 2009. Nothing unexpected as this year I haven't been able to go to [Tierra de Nadie (TdN)](http://jornadas-tdn.org/) or any similar convention. Not attending TdN implies for at least 25-30 plays less.
* I've played only 33 different games this year, and incredibly most of them were new (to me).
* I recorded 36 gaming sessions, 3 per month.
* This year I've played from time to time in [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/). Chronologically:
  - I completed [Baldur's Gate II](https://store.steampowered.com/app/257350/Baldurs_Gate_II_Enhanced_Edition/)
  - I played for a while to [Icewind Dale](https://store.steampowered.com/app/321800/Icewind_Dale_Enhanced_Edition/)
  - I finished [Life is Strange: Episode 1](https://store.steampowered.com/app/319630/Life_is_Strange__Episode_1/)
  - I also completed [The Witcher](https://store.steampowered.com/app/20900/The_Witcher_Enhanced_Edition_Directors_Cut/)
* By the end of the year I acquired [Stadia Founder's Edition](https://stadia.google.com/). I started trying it with [Destiny 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_2) but definitely enjoyed my new Stadia with [Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Raider_(2013_video_game)).
* My <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index"><b><i>h-index</i></b></a> as a player is still at <b>11</b>. I expected to raise it this year, but I haven't since I almost played new games.

## Retrospective

* I still enjoy a lot playing boardgames, role playing games and video games so I will keep this as one of my main leisure activities for 2019
* In January 2018 we finished [Pandemic Legacy Season 1](https://rpggeek.com/boardgame/161936/pandemic-legacy-season-1) the campaign we started back in 2016, but after that I haven't played any other legacy game. I still love cooperative games and I would not reject starting one with a stable playing group, maybe the recently announced [**Journeys in the Middle Earth**](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2019/1/11/the-lord-of-the-rings-journeys-in-middle-earth/)?
* I am becoming addicted to **escape room inspired board games**. In 2018 I have played several [Unlock!](https://rpggeek.com/boardgamefamily/39442/unlock) and [Exit](https://rpggeek.com/boardgamefamily/36963/exit-das-spiel) and for 2019 my goal is to play all the published games of those two families
* I managed (with my party and DM) to maintain since March a monthly [**Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition**](https://rpggeek.com/rpg/17181/dungeons-dragons-5th-edition) campaign, and I only missed one session because of a trip. That is very good news for me and for the entire group, we are [enjoying it a lot](http://ghilbrae.com/tag/storm-kings-thunder/) so we will hopefully continue with the same frequency and passion.
* I'm still eager to play prototypes, but since early 2018 I am no longer a member of [**Asociaci√≥n Ludo**](http://www.asociacionludo.com/). I was not involved at all so, although I miss some of my colleagues there, I decided to leave after realizing that the association does not benefit from me if I'm only providing economic support. I will consider returning when I'm capable of offering more :-(
